    <h2 id="facebook">Playlists</h2>
    
    <p>A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together for playback in a Brightcove Player. Two types of playlists can be created using the Media module, <strong>Manual</strong> and <strong>Smart</strong>. With a Manual playlist, you select the videos that are in the playlist. With Smart playlists, videos are automatically added to the playlist based upon the tags that associated with videos.</p>
    
    <p>Published playlists appear next to the player and allow the user to select which videos they want to watch.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Playlist (Vertical)</strong> - Playlist displays on the right side of the player.

      <li><strong>Playlist (Horizontal)</strong> - Playlist displays on the bottom of the player.

    <h2 id="retranscode">Retranscoding videos</h2>
    
    <p>When videos are uploaded using the Upload module, the selected ingest profile (similar to Backlot's processing profile) determines the quality and number of renditions that are created. The Media module can be used to retranscode existing videos using a different ingest profile. Retranscoding will create a new set of renditions for the video. Retranscoding saves you from having re-upload the video, re-enter the video metadata and any existing video analytics are not lost.</p>

    <div class="BCL-concept">
    <h2 id="metadata">Custom metadata</h2>
    
    <p>Custom metadata can be used to add additional metadata fields to your videos. In Backlot, custom metadata can be added for each video. With Video Cloud, custom fields are added as part of your account settings. This makes these fields available to all videos that are uploaded. After the custom fields have been added, the fields can be assigned values using the Media module.</p>
    
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Custom metadata is available only for Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise customers. If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</p>

    <div class="BCL-concept">
    <h2 id="sharing">Media sharing</h2>
    
    <p>Media sharing allows publishers to upload videos once and then share the videos to other accounts. The accounts can be your own, corporate accounts or accounts of other publishers. The shared videos can then be used independently in the other Video Cloud accounts. Media sharing is typically used when publishers want to keep a master account of video content and then share videos out to other divisions or subsidiaries of the organization.</p>
    
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Media sharing is available only for Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise customers. If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</p>

    <h2 id="reports">Custom reports</h2>
    
    <p>While both Backlot and Video Cloud offer various types of video and player analytics in the UI, Video Cloud offers the ability to create and schedule custom analytics reports. This allows you to create reports with the specific data fields you want to see. Reports can be filtered to return a subset of your video data and can be scheduled to run on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.</p>
    
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Custom reports are available only for Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise customers. If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</p>

    <h2 id="gallery">Video experiences</h2>
    
    <p>The Gallery module provides the ability to create engaging video experiences without the need for any coding. Different types of experiences are available with the most popular being:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Portals</strong> - Stand-alone video experience (video portal). An example can be seen <a href="https://video.brightcovelearning.com">here</a>.</li>
