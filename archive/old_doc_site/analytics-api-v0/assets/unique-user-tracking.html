      <p>Unique user tracking feature is useful in identifying the number of unique browsers ( which may roughly equate to actual unique users ) sending events. This means if the same browser was to send 2 <code>video_view</code> events, they would be recorded as a single unique entity.</p>

<p>The users can be tracked by two means:</p>

<ol>
<li>A Server side browser cookie</li>
<li>Client side unique identifier</li>
</ol><h1>

<p>User tracking is enabled only when the <code>cookies_enabled</code> parameter is set to any value other than <code>false</code>. This includes the case where no value is set, i.e., if the player sends an event with <code>cookies_enabled=</code>, we would still not track the user. Also, if the <code>user</code> parameter is specified, we would continue to track the user.</p>

<p>This is the most common and simplest use case. If the player sends a request to the analytics collector with the <code>track</code> flag set. The server will generate a cookie with name <code>bcau</code> and value set to a <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">UUID</a>. This cookie would be set with a <code>max-age</code> of 365 days after which a new cookie would be set. </p>

<ol>
<li>The max age of the cookie is reset on every visit to 365 days.</li>
<li>If the cookie tracking is disabled (by sending <code>cookies_enabled=false</code>) the collector would simply not continue to set/reset cookies and will no longer record user tracking information. This implies that the cookies that are already set would continue to exist on the viewer's browser until they are cleared but would not be used by the collection system.</li>

<p>In certain cases, such as native mobile apps or certain browsers (cookies disabled), it may be difficult or impossible to accept/set/store cookies. In this scenario, the user/client application may create a unique identifier (such as a device UUID) and send it as a the <code>user</code> query parameter.</p>
