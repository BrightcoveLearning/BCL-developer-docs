<h3>Unique user tracking</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the player/client application wants to track the unique viewer they should send a unique Id for the user as the <code>user</code> parameter to the collector.</li>
<li>If the user is not provided or is blank, we use the fallback method of using the <code>(Source IP address + the User-Agent String)</code> as the unique identifier.</li>
<li>The value of the user parameter is never stored in the logs or database. Only a hash (using SHA-256) is stored.</li>
<li>No cookies are set by the collector.</li>
</ul>
