By default we automatically update all players on a regular basis so that they can take advantage of new features and fixes without any effort required from our customers.  While we do not recommend opting out of updates in most cases we realize that from time to time some customers would prefer that their players remain untouched completely (for instance they have done rigorous testing in preparation for a big event and they don’t want to risk anything changing at all).

If you find the need to opt out of player updates for a period of time the simplest way is by applying a PATCH to your player’s configuration object.  An example of this via a curl statement would look like this:

account=123
player=234

curl -X PATCH -H "Content-type: application/json" -d ‘{"player":{"template":{"locked":true}}}’ https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$account/players/$player/configuration

This adds the locked setting to your preview player.  To lock it in you would then publish the player:

curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d ‘{"comment":"Locking the player for our XYZ event."}’ https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$account/players/$player/publish

When you are ready to opt back in to updates you do the opposite steps.  First you change locked to false like so:

curl -X PATCH -H "Content-type: application/json" -d ‘{"player":{"template":{"locked":false}}}’ https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$account/players/$player/configuration

This will update your preview player to the current player template version if it is different from what you currently have.  You should test with the preview player URL that is returned by this call to ensure that your player still functions as expected.  Once satisfied you then publish the player to make the new player go live.

curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d ‘{"comment":"Turning automatic updates back on."}’ https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/$account/players/$player/publish
