                <p><strong style="color:#990000">Note:</strong> by default, updates are applied to all players automatically. To prevent auto-updating of a player you must set it to manual updating (also known as locking a player). You can do this in the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/docs/setting-player-update-mode-and-version">Studio Players module</a> or using the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/player-management/guides/opting-out-automatic-updates.html">Player Management API</a>.</p>
                <p>Opting out of auto-updates should be a temporary measure, applied while you resolve any issues that the update creates. If you do not update players to the current version, you are missing out on new features and bug-fixes, and older versions of the player will cease to be supported at some point</p>

            <h3>New features</h3>
            <p>Brightcove Player version 5 has new support for HLS video without using Flash. In this release, in all browsers that support the Media Source Extensions API (MSE), the Brightcove Player can play HLS videos <strong>without Flash!</strong> That means Flash is not used on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Flash will still be used for older versions of IE but can be disabled by config.</p>
            <p>MSE HLS provides several huge benefits:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Videos will load fast and play smoothly, even at high resolutions and high frame rates, <strong>including 4K and 60FPS video - on modest hardware</strong></li>
                <li>It uses approximately <strong>-50% of the CPU load</strong> to render the same videos, meaning batteries will last longer and your laptop fan won’t turn on</li>
                <li>Power saving and other browser settings to limit the use of Flash will <strong>no longer have any effect on the player</strong> regardless of the player’s dimensions</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Other features in this release include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>New skin</strong> - Based on significant UX research we have built a new skin that incorporates many changes. These include a new, centered big play button, new colors, new seek bar behavior, and a new title bar called the dock. Usability testing participants especially loved the new timeline that expands on hover and makes it easier to seek to a specific time. You can now choose between the default new skin, called Luna, and the old 1.x skin, now called Graphite.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial support for live captions</strong> - this release now supports many 608/708 caption encoding systems. This includes support for the popular pop-on and roll-up methods and basic styling</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility mode</strong> for all 1.x and Video.js 4.x plugins. (except DASH/DRM, FreeWheel, and OnceUX plugins - updates to follow during Q1)</li>
            </ol>
                <p>Also in this version, we have made many updates to improve the programming model for customization, including simplifications to our skinning model and the API for plugins. These changes bring us up-to-date with our latest open source release, Video.js 5, <a href="http://blog.videojs.com/post/130143694631/video-js-5">which you can read about here</a>. You will also notice that we have also synchronized our version numbering between Video.js and Brightcove Player releases.</p>
