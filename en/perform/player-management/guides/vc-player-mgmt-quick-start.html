          <h1>Quick Start to Player Management</h1>
          <p>In this quick start you will perform the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a Node.js application to act as your OAuth security proxy. This proxy will use your access token to make calls to the needed APIs.</li>
            <li>Obtain credentials to use the Content Management System (CMS) API.</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>a</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="BCL-aside">For details on the API used in this document you can view the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/cms-api/guides/overview-cms.html">Content Management System API Overview</a> document and the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/cms-api/reference/versions/v1/index.html">Content Management System API</a> reference.</p>
          <p class="text-warning">Note: The steps in the document involve curl and other command-line tools that are native to Mac and Linux systems, but not part of the Windows operating system. If you are on Windows, you can get these tools by installing <a href="//cygwin.com">cygwin</a>. During the install you will be prompted for packages to install. Open the <strong>Net</strong> package, then check the <strong>curl</strong> option and then finish the installation. Once you have done this you will be able to follow the Quick Start to the Content Management System successfully as written using the cygwin command line. Tools are available to run curl at the normal Windows command line, but not detailed in this document.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="oauthproxy" class="section">
          <h2>Create proxy</h2>
          <p>Security on the Player Management API uses OAuth2. This requires some work to access the API. </p>
          <ol>
          <li>In this quick start it is recommended you set up a Node.js application to act as a proxy. The <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/oauth-api/guides/quick-start.html">OAuth Quick Start</a> guides you through the steps to create a basic proxy in Node.js that gets an access token for a Brightcove API, makes the API call, and then returns the response data.</li>
          <li>You will also need a local web server running to serve up a testing page, <strong>tester.html</strong>, which works with the proxy. Note that simply browsing the page as a file will NOT work as the page utilizes an iframe, which requires an HTTP server.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="obtaincredentials" class="section">
          <h2>Obtain credentials</h2>
          <p>To use the CMS API you will need proper credentials. Later in this quick start, you will use the credentials in a form when submitting requests to APIs.</p> 
          <ol start="3">
            <li>To obtain proper credentials use your choice of these two options (Be sure to read the paragraph following the bullets to ensure you ask for the proper operations):</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
              <li><a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/oauth-api/guides/get-client-credentials.html">OAuth: Get Client Credentials Using CURL</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/oauth-api/guides/get-client-credentials-postman.html">OAuth: Get Client Credentials Using Postman</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Whichever option you choose, you will need to ask for the correct operation permissions. In this quick start you will need both <strong>video</strong> and <strong>ingest-profile</strong> operations. The following can be used with curl or Postman to get the proper permissions:</p>
          <p><code data-gist-id="a809ddf9afa419a5bb04" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="1-4"></code></p>
        </div>
      <div id="createplayer" class="section">
        <h2>Create player</h2>
        <p>Of course part of the Player Managment API is to create a Brightcove player. This player will play a Video Cloud video. You will use an HTTP <code>POST</code> method and pass in the player name and Video Cloud video that will play.</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>You will now use the proxy in conjunction with the <strong>tester.html</strong> page to create a player and configure the Video Cloud video to be played. This configuration information will be passed to the API as a JSON object. Browse to <strong>tester.html</strong> and complete the form as follows:</li>

              <li>Copy the <code>embed_code</code> into an HTML page to view your player in an iframe. For this to function properly, the page containing the iframe must be served from an actual HTTP server.</li>

      <div id="updateplayer" class="section">
        <h2>Update player</h2>
        <p>You can change a player you have created. In this section you will implement a very simple update, replacing in the player one Video Cloud video with another. You will use an HTTP <code>PATCH</code> method and pass in a new Video Cloud video. You will see more complex update update use cases later in this document.</p>
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: In this case you are using an API call to update the video. In the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/brightcove-player/guides/dynamically-change-video.html">Dynamically Changing the Video</a> document, you see an example of changing the video on a user event.</p>
        <ol start="6">
          <li>You will now use the proxy in conjunction with the <strong>tester.html</strong> page to update the player to play a new Video Cloud video.

          </tr>         
        </table>
          <p>After you click the <strong>Submit</strong> button, you will have players that differ from the preview versions. The published versions differ from the preview versions in these ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The JavaScript and CSS are minified, concatenated and inlined into the player directly.</li>
            <li>A low resolution version of the poster image is generated and inlined into the page to improve perceived load times on networks with a high request-setup time (i.e. cellular data networks).</li>
            <li>The previous version of the player is saved so it can be recovered if problems are discovered after the update goes live.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="BCL-aside">Note: On player creation (step 4 above) the player is also automatically published. That is why on player creation the JSON response included both published and preview information.</p>
          <ol start="9"><li>Check to be sure the JSON response from publishing the player appears as follows:</li>
          <p><code data-gist-id="a809ddf9afa419a5bb04" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-line="28-33"></code></p>
          <li>Use one of the player implementations to be sure your published player if functioning correctly.</li>
        </ol>
                <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Now that you have seen the how the form and proxy interact, the remaining examples will  only list the form elements that change, with the results following.</p>
