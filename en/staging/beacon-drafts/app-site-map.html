        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document will lead you through a series of questions about how you want the layout of your OTT app to appear. The result of answering these questions will help you build your "site map" for the Brightcove Beacon Experience. A very simple example of what you want to have defined for your app is pictured here:</p>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/beacon/site-map/top-level-example.jpeg" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>You may not have experience in designing a UX for an OTT app. In the last section of this doc, <a href="Is_there_guidance">Is there guidance?</a>, a list of resources from vendors advice is shown. You may wish to read and consider their guidance before designing your UI.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="What_are_logical_categories_for_your_media_assets">What are logical categories for your media assets?</h2>
        <p>For an effective presentation of your video assets you need to consider logical categories for those assets. The driving force behind the categories should be can your customers find the videos they want logically and quickly.</p>
        <h3>Types of categories</h3>
        <p>You have two types of categories to choose from, they are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Those that you build. Under the hood, the categories you build are actually playlists built in Video Cloud Studio.</li>
          <li>Those that Brightcove Beacon automatically creates, those being <em>Recently Watch</em>, <em>Most Watched</em> and <em>Favorites</em>. Further details are provided in the next section of this document.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>Some examples are shown here to help focus on what it means to choose categories.</p>
        <p><strong>Example from Above</strong></p>
        <p>In the example above you see the categories are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PLAY! Live Channels</li>
          <li>Travel Channel</li>
          <li>The Cooking Channel</li>
          <li>Recommended for You</li>
          <li>Brightcvoe Library</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">The categories will always appear in uppercase in the actual UI.</aside>

        <p><strong>Movie Categories</strong></p>
        <p>Below are some of the categories, or genres, for movies taken from Wikipedia:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Action</li>
          <li>Adventure</li>
          <li>Comedy</li>
          <li>Crime</li>
          <li>Drama</li>
          <li>Fantasy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here the genres work well as categories as your customers are most likely familiar with this type of categorization.</p>
        <p><strong>College Athletics</strong></p>
        <p>It might be that the large quantity of categories at the top level. For instance, there are 347 Division 1 (generally large) schools. You could have the home screen of your app list all 347 schools, but some customers would most likely find that long list too scroll through a poor user experience. You can use sub-categories, or even sub-categories of sub-categories to make the search for a particular set of videos easier. The following displays a partial structure of
          possible categories for a college athletics site. Here the structure follows the <em>Conference -> School -> Sport</em> organizational structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>South Eastern Conference
            <ul>
              <li>Florida
                <ul>
                  <li>Football</li>
                  <li>Basketball</li>
                  <li>Volleyball</li>
                  <li>...</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Georgia
                <ul>
                  <li>Football</li>
                  <li>Basketball</li>
                  <li>Volleyball</li>
                  <li>...</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Pac-12 Conference
            <ul>
              <li>Arizona
                <ul>
                  <li>Football</li>
                  <li>Basketball</li>
                  <li>Volleyball</li>
                  <li>...</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Oregon
                <ul>
                  <li>Football</li>
                  <li>Basketball</li>
                  <li>Volleyball</li>
                  <li>...</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you believe the sport, rather than the conference, is most important to your customers you would maybe change the categorization to follow the <em>Sport -> Conference -> School</em> organizational structure.</p>
        <h3>Your Categories</h3>
        <p>From the examples you can see deciding on your categories and organization structure might be a straightforward, or very complex, task. Take time now to think through and document your organization structure and/or categories.</p>

      <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="What_Brightcove_Beacon_built_categories_do_you_want">What Brightcove Beacon built categories do you want?</h2>
        <p>Brightcove Beacon can provide three categories you can choose to include or not. They are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recently Watch - </li>
          <li>Most Watched - </li>
          <li>Favorites - This category is dynamically built as customers mark video assets as a favorite</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="In_what_order_should_the_categories_be_placed">In what order should the categories be placed?</h2>
        <p>Now that you have determined the categories you want for you app, you need to decide in what order they need to appear. Using your work from the last two sections, document here the order the categories should in your app.</p>
      </section>
