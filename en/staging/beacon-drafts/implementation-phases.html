        <section class="bcls-section">
          <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
          <p>In this document, a high-level look at the entire process of implementing Brightcove Beacon is provided. It will emphasize that you as a customer have a number of tasks to perform before meeting with a Brightcove representative to build
            your device apps.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="bcls-section">
          <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
          <p>In this section, the phases are introduced, briefly defined and the result of the phase is stated. Later in the document, checklists, where appropriate, are provided to help you prepare for each phase.</p>
          <h3>Phase 1: Prepare for Brightcove Beacon Experience Creation</h3>
          <p>Later in the Brightcove Beacon implementation process (Phase 4), you will build the Brightcove Beacon Experience. You will do this while working with a Brightcove representative. At this time you will need to have some design artifacts
            ready, as well as decisions made on platforms to which you wish to deploy, monetization strategy, advertising strategy, etc.</p>
          <p><strong>END RESULT</strong>: A collection of resources and strategies defined for use when meeting with a Brightcove representative to build the Brightcove Beacon Experience.</p>
          <h3>Phase 2: Establish Relationships with 3rd Party Vendors</h3>
          <p>There are numerous relationships with 3rd party vendors you need to establish before meeting with a Brightcove representative to build the Brightcove Beacon Experience. This would include contacting the vendors for the platforms to
            which you choose to deploy an app, an advertising server provider, Stripe for online payments, etc. <em>It is VERY IMPORTANT that this process starts as early as possible as to not cause delays at time of device app submission.</em></p>
          <p><strong>END RESULT</strong>: Accounts created with all desired 3rd party vendors for use when meeting with a Brightcove representative to build the Brightcove Beacon Experience.</p>
          <h3>Phase 3: Add Content and Configure Your Brightcove Beacon Experience</h3>
          <p>Here you will use the Brightcove Beacon Administrative Console to configure your experience. Here you will import media assets from Video Cloud, and add other content. Configuration of monetization and layout are also done.</p>
          <p><strong>END RESULT</strong>: Via the Brightcove Beacon, content is added and configuration performed.</p>
          <h3>Phase 4: Create Device Application(s) from Your Brightcove Beacon Experience</h3>
          <p>You will work with a Brightcove representative to build the Brightcove Beacon Experience. The work done in Phases 1, 2 and 3 is utilized to create the experience. From the Brightcove Beacon Experience, the device apps are built.</p>
          <p><strong>END RESULT</strong>: The device app files are created and available for submission to desired vendors/stores.</p>
          <h3>Phase 5: Submit Your Device Application(s) to Corresponding Store(s)</h3>
          <p>At this point you have the applications for your desired platforms in hand, as well as configuration performed, so you can now submit the applications.</p>
          <p>END RESULT: Device apps appropriately submitted and viewers begin to use the apps on vendor approval.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="bcls-section">
          <h2 id="Phases_timing">Phases timing</h2>
          <p>Note that Phases 1 and 2 can and should be executed simultaneously.</p>

            <img class="bcls-image" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/beacon/implementation-phases/phases.png" alt="">
          </figure>
          <p>Of course, once the device applications are launched, you can continue to configure and add content to Brightcove Beacon without having to resubmit your device applications to their respective stores.</p>

          <p>It may be that in Phase 3 all configuration is done, all content is added, all users configured, but you may want to do further configuration and content addition before the apps are used. You can perform this additional work in this phase before the device app(s) go live. You will use the Brightcove Beacon Experience Administrative Console to perform further configuration.</p>

          <p>This phase takes place with the assistance of Brightcove personnel. The assets, vendor relationships, defined strategies, etc. from the first three phases are used by the Brightcove representative to build and do initial configuration of the Brightcove Beacon Experience. From this collaboration, the actual device app files are generated from Brightcove Beacon.</p>

          <p> For each vendor for which you have a device app, you must submit the app to the corresponding store. In Phase 2 you previously established a relationship with the vendor’s platform, so in this phase you submit the app to begin the approval process. In the <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/staging/beacon-drafts/bcb-creating-your-apps-tabbed.html">Submitting Device Apps to Stores</a> document you will find specific steps and links to appropriate vendor documentation for help in the submission process.</p>
