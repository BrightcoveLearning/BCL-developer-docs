          <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
          <p>In May of 2018 Brightcove released version 3 of the IMA Advertising plugin. The update includes many major improvements in reliability, and other areas which will be detailed in the next section of this document. The update is for Brightcove Player version 6 and higher only. Existing version 6 players will not be migrated to version 3 automatically as some integrations may need to be updated to support the new version. Brightcove encourages you to read this document fully and then test the changes before upgrading.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bcls-section">
          <h2 id="Improvements">Improvements</h2>
          <p>The following list improvements made in version 3 of the plugin:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The pluginâ€™s handling of video source changes has been fundamentally reworked, resulting in far greater reliability when used with playlists.</li>
            <li>Setting the server URL can now be delayed, allowing for easy integration of asynchronous workflows such as header bidding or macros based on media info. Detailed examples will be published later.</li>
            <li>A bug has been fixed that could have led to a longer timeout than expected.</li>
            <li>Flash support has been removed to improve performance.</li>
            <li>Various additional bug fixes and reliability improvements are rolled into the new version.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="bcls-section">
          <h2 id="Technical_details">Technical details</h2>
          <p>To improve reliability, the Brightcove IMA plugin has updated its dependency on <strong>videojs-contrib-ads</strong>, the open source Video.js ad framework, to version 6. This is a major maintenance update. You can learn more about <strong>videojs-contrib-ads</strong> version 6 on the <a href="http://blog.videojs.com/videojs-contrib-ads-6/">Video.js blog</a>.</p>
          <p>This update removes a root cause of some content flashes that appeared before prerolls. The solution uses <a href="https://blog.videojs.com/feature-spotlight-middleware/">Video.js middleware</a> to do a quick play+pause at the beginning of playback.</p>

          <h2 id="Migrating_to_version_3">Migrating to version 3</h2>
          <p>Existing players will NOT be automatically upgraded to version 3 of the Brightcove IMA plugin. In the default (legacy) Studio interface, version 2 of the IMA plugin will always be used, as it has in the past. In the beta (new) Studio interface, the Advertising section will soon have a dropdown to allow you to pick which version of the IMA Plugin is used. This new interface can be used to migrate players. Brightcove strongly recommend reviewing your integration and carefully testing your player when upgrading.</p>
          <p>New created players will use version 3 by default when advertising is enabled. They can be manually set to version 2 if needed.</p>
          <p>Changes that may require integrations to be updated:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You may want to test to make sure you were not depending on a timeout longer than what is specified in your configuration.</li>
            <li>The <code>ended</code> events are no longer delayed by one second. If your integration responds to <code>ended</code> events, you should test that the integration continues to work as expected. Generally, this means that such integrations will perform better.</li>
            <li>player.ads.state is now deprecated. We have seen it used by some integrations to check if the player is in ad mode, but it is generally done incorrectly. A better alternative is to check player.ads.isInAdMode().</li>
            <li>The contentplayback event has been removed. It is an implementation detail that is no longer needed, but we have found that some integrations use it. Use the playing event instead.</li>
            <li>Beginning of ad playback is indicated by the ads-ad-started event, which fires exactly once when each ad begins. While the adplaying event will continue to be emitted, it may now be emitted multiple times per ad play, so we therefore recommend using the ads-ad-started event instead.</li>
          </ul>
