<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Stream concurrency allows a customer to limit the number of videos a specific user can watch at any given time. This feature hooks into the DRM workflow so it is secure and can be used with minimal integration.</p>

<p>If you are new to this feature, see the <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/en/staging/pas/overview-playback-authorization-service.html">Overview: DRM with Playback Authorization Service</a> document.</p>

</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>To use stream concurrency with Brightcove's Playback Authorization Service, follow the steps in the <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/en/staging/pas/technical-workflow-pas.html">Implementing DRM with Playback Authorization Service</a> document.</p>
<p>
  Be sure to include the <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/en/staging/pas/technical-workflow-pas.html#Generate_JWT_token">JWT token claims</a> required for concurrency.
</p>

<h2 id="Behavior_examples">Behavior examples</h2>
<p>
  The following examples demonstrate different strategies for limiting playback streams.
</p>
<h3>General Behavior</h3>
<p>
  For DRM systems supporting renewal requests, DRMtoday uses a defensive limiting strategy, where the oldest session is stopped first, once its
upcoming renewal request is processed. This has the advantage of always granting the most recent user request vs. denying new requests because
other playbacks are believed to be in progress, but not known with certainty. (e.g. a device or network failure).

  <strong>User activity:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Amy, Ben and Claire enjoy watching a movie.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dave decides to  also start watching, causing Amy's upcoming renewal request to be denied.
  </li>
  <li>
    Amy restarts the movie, now causing Ben's renewal request to fail.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ben starts watching another movie some time later, causing Claire's movie to stop.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>PlayReady Only</h3>
<p>
  Microsoft PlayReady does not support renewal requests, but uses secure stop instead. The only way to limit the total number of streams is to deny any new sessions.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>User activity:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Amy, Ben and Claire enjoy watching another movie.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dave decides to also start watching, but his request is denied due to the limit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Amy stops watching and her player sends the secure stop request. This opens a new slot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dave can now use the new slot.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>PlayReady: Secure Stop</h3>
<p>
  In case the secure stop signal is not received, the session duration limit applies.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>User activity:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Amy, Ben and Claire enjoy watching a movie.
  </li>
  <li>
    Amy's device is crashing and not sending the secure stop request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dave also wants to watch, but his request is still denied.
  </li>
  <li>
    The session duration is reached and the slot is available again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dave can now watch his movie.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>PlayReady interaction with other DRM types</h3>
<p>
  When the maximum number of sessions has been reached by PlayReady requests, even Google Widevine and Apple FairPlay license requests are denied and don't lead to new sessions.

  <strong>User activity:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Amy, Ben and Claire enjoy watching a movie.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dave decides to also start watching, causing Ben's movie to stop. He's using a device supporting renewal requests and is upcoming request gets denied.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ben decides to switch to another device supporting secure stop, causing Dave's next renewal request to fail. Now, all slots are occupied by devices with secure stop.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dave has no free slot to watch.
  </li>
  <li>
    Amy stops watching, which frees a slot for Dave to use.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>The following limitations apply with the initial release of this feature:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    For HLSe (AES-128), the token will be appended to the master manifest request, and will propagate to the encryption key URL. Because these URLs are appended to the master manifest, customers should consider restricting the number of uses to minimize exposure of their content.
  </li>
  <li>
    For HLSe (AES-128), players will make mutlitple requests when playing a video, typically one per rendition. The <a href="#Generate_JWT_token">maxu claim</a> needs to be set high enough to account for these requests. You should consider additional claims to minimize the exposure of your content. Switching renditions will request a new license.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tracking of the <a href="#Generate_JWT_token">maxu and maxip claims</a> is eventually consistent. This means that if a token using these claims is reused many times in quick succession, it is possible to see that token accepted more times than those claims declare. The tracking becomes consistent within a few seconds and after that window the token will be blocked as expected.
  </li>
</ul>
