      <article class="bcls-article">
      <section class="bcls-section">
      <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

      <p>The Native SDK for iOS allows you to create mobile apps which include Offline playback of your video content, while keeping it secure with a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/streaming/fps/">FairPlay Streaming</a> solution. The Native SDK simplifies your implementation for download management, offline catalog management, analytics, offline playback and DRM.</p>

      <p>The Offline playback feature is included in the latest version of the Brightcove Native SDK. For details, see the <a href="https://brightcovelearning.github.io/Brightcove-API-References/ios-sdk/index.html">Brightcove Native Player SDK for iOS</a> reference.</p>

      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">To use this feature, you need to be a Video Cloud customer using Dynamic Delivery.</aside>
      </section>

      <section class="bcls-section">
      <h2 id="Supported_versions">Supported versions</h2>

      <p>Offline DRM is supported on the following OS versions:</p>

      <ul>
      	<li>iOS 10.0, but 10.3+ is recommended</li>
      </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="bcls-section">
      <h2 id="Prepare_videos">Prepare videos</h2>

      <p>For the SDKs to mark a video as downloadable, you need to use the <a href="/node/18034">CMS API</a> to set the <a href="/node/18023#videoFields">offline_enabled</a> field to a value of <strong>true</strong>.</p>

      <p>Here is an example using curl:</p>

      <pre class="line-numbers" data-start="1">
      <code class="language-json">curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $oauth_token" --request PATCH --data '
      {"offline_enabled" : true}
      ' https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/<span class="bcls-input">your account id</span>/videos/<span class="bcls-input">your video id</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>Setting this field is similar to the steps found in the <a href="/node/18014">Setting 360-Video Properties with the CMS API</a> document.</p>

      <h2 id="Security_features">Security features</h2>

      <p>The following security features are related to offline playback with the Native SDK for iOS.</p>

      <h3>AirPlay</h3>

      <p>You cannot stream an offline HLS video to an AirPlay device for playback. This is confirmed by Apple to be an <code>AVFoundation</code> limitation.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="bcls-section">
      	<h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2>
        <p>
          Below you will find answers to some general questions.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bcls-question">Is there a duration set for the license expiration?</h3>

        <p class="bcls-answer">License expiration is enforced by FairPlay. iOS handles all checking for clock changes, etc. An app has the option of checking the license expiration to alert the user that the license has expired. This may be preferable to simply playing back an expired video and then receiving a playback error.</p>

        <h3 class="bcls-question">Will the license and offline videos continue loading while the app is in the background?</h3>

        <p class="bcls-answer">License loading should happen in the foreground. We have a method to preload the license.
Downloading of the main video content can happen while the app is in the background.</p>

        <h3 class="bcls-question">What is the video format(s) used during offline playback for iOS?</h3>

        <p class="bcls-answer">iOS uses HLS steaming for downloads. You can specify a bitrate for the download to use a specific variant.</p>

        <h3 class="bcls-question">Will downloaded videos playback locally or streaming when the user is online?</h3>

        <p class="bcls-answer">A downloaded video can be played back while online or offline, but it will always use the downloaded video. If you choose to play back an online version of the video, you should retrieve a new video object from the Playback Service. The offline video can only be played from local storage.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="bcls-section">
      <h2 id="Known_Issues">Known issues</h2>

      <p>The following known issues are related to offline playback with the Native SDK for iOS.</p>

      <h3>Playback During Download</h3>

      <p>While a movie is being downloaded, you can play the movie by passing the <code>BCOVVideo</code> object to the <code>BCOVPlaybackController</code> just like any other movie. We do this by using an internal reference stored in the currently active <code>AVAssetDownloadTask</code> (this is the method recommended by Apple to make the download and playback as efficient as possible).</p>

      <p>Doing this has several potentially unexpected side effects:</p>

      <ul>
      	<li>When you start playing, progress on the download task may stop. The <code>AVPlayer</code> appears to take over all network activity to give priority to buffering and displaying the playing video. This appears to be normal behavior.</li>
      	<li>When you stop playing, the download task may not resume. That will happen if the video’s session is still active in the <code>BCOVPlaybackController</code>. To clear out the current session, you can play a new video, or delete the playback controller. Be sure you don’t store the current session in a strong property.</li>
      	<li>When you begin playback of a video that is downloading, the <code>AVPlayer</code> may initially seek to the end of the video, requiring the user to manually seek back to the beginning. This is an issue with the <code>AVPlayer</code> in iOS 10.3, and is expected to be fixed in iOS 11. You can work around this issue programmatically by checking to see if the progress reported by the playback controller starts near the end of your video within a few seconds after playback begins; if you detect this condition you can seek back to zero and it should play normally.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Playing the Same Offline Video Twice</h3>

      <p>Unexpected network activity can occur when playing the same offline video two times in a row in a certain way. If you play a video with one playback controller, and then immediately play the same video with another playback controller, the <code>AVPlayer</code> for the second video may opt to retrieve its video data from the Internet rather than from local storage. (If the device is not online then the <code>AVPlayer</code> may not play the second video.)</p>

      <p>We believe this happens when two AVPlayers are in memory for a brief time referencing the same video in local storage. It’s unknown exactly why the <code>AVPlayer</code> switches to playing the online version; we will address this with Apple when we can more precisely narrow down the behavior.</p>

      <p>When possible, a better way to play the same video twice is to simply seek the same playback controller to timecode zero and play again.</p>
