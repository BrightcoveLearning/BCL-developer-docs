**Creating Player Implementation Code

The first thing needed to do player development is a player, so let’s do that.

In Studio select Players module
  -click on the new player button
  -then give it a name
  -and finally click save.

That’s it.

Now that we have a player we want to publish a video using that player.

Go to the media module
 -pick a video to publish
 -click the publishing button, then web player
 -choose the player you just created
 -click advanced, which is the best selection when doing development with a player
 -make it a fixed size
 -enter the width you want
 -then copy the advance code

And we’re ready to start development



**Preparing to Write Code
Now that we have the advanced player implementation code, let’s build a web page to use it

Paste the code into the body of an HTML page

Next enter an ID for this video element, this is needed to address the video object in JavaScript.

Now create a JavaScript block, where the actual player development code will be placed.

To talk to the video element, use the getPlayer() method. Here the ID is used that was associated earlier with the video element.

Next a JavaScript variable is created that is used in the JavaScript code to talk to the player.

Assign the variable the "this" keyword,  which represents the player.

We have now created a standard, best practice approach to prepare for writing actual code to affect the player.


**Autoplaying a video
It might seem we could use the play() method, and the video would play. Actually, this MIGHT work, but we can't write code that doesn't always workflow.

Two issues need to be address, they are:
1. Is the video ready to play?
2.
