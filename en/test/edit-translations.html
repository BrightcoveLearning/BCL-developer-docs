      <h1>Editing Translations</h1>
      <p>You will save yourself time and trouble by reading these instructions carefully before you start editing translations!</p>
      <h2>What you need to know:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>URL parameter to enable the translation editor: <code>?language_edit=1</code></li>
        <li>username: <code>dev-54ta5gq-6sglloa4yrkti</code></li>
        <li>password: <code>s69bHkr7</code></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>IMPORTANT: Before you begin</h2>
      <p>If the problem (or part of it) is things translated that should not be (such as product names or code), <strong>it is better to fix that in the English source rather than edit the translation.</strong> Just submit a KNOW ticket indicating the page URL, and whether the issue is product names, code, or something else. The Learning Services team will fix it.</p>
      <h3>Limitations of the editor</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Every HTML tag is treated as a separate editable block. That means you can only make changes within that block, and you cannot change the order of blocks. See the <a href="#paragraphs">editing paragraphs</a> section below for a partial exception.</li>
        <li>The Neural Network (the artificial intelligence part of the system) is both a help and an obstacle:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Good</strong>: when you change one instance of a mis-translated phrase, you should see other instances on the same page automatically changed. In a day or two, you will also see the same correction automatically made in other pages. So don't waste time making the same correction on multiple pages - the system will do that for you.</li>
          <li><strong>The Bad</strong>: it is not totally reliable, though. It sometimes misses fixing instances, I think because they are in a different kind of tag (a list item or table cell rather than a paragraph, for example).</li>
          <li><strong>The Ugly</strong>: worse than missing some, it is all or nothing. The change will be made everywhere, even if you do not want it to be. For example, there is no way to specify that "Audience" should not be translated when it is used a product name, but should be translated if it is used as a ordinary word. You have to choose what is the less bad thing to do in those cases.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you delete all the text for a translation in the edit dialog, the original machine translation will be restored - that block of text will <strong>not</strong> disappear. you can, however, replace a block of text with just a period (.) or a comma (,).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Things you should <strong>not</strong> edit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Code blocks</strong> - these should never be translated - we can fix the source to prevent that. Please submit a KNOW ticket with the URL.</li>
        <li><strong>XNUMX</strong> - this is a placeholder for a number - the number from the English source doc will always be used. You will see the number when you leave editing mode.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Open a KNOW ticket (via JIRA or email to docs@brightcove.com) so that we can keep track of what pages have been edited. Note that you can assign the KNOW ticket to a reviewer when you're finished, if you like.</li>
        <li>Open the page in your browser in the language you want to edit.</li>
        <li>Add the URL param <code>?language_edit=1</code> to the end of the URL, and press <strong>return</strong> to reload the page.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">

            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Add URL Param</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><strong>Note that you must remove any hash (such as <code>#introduction</code>) from the URL before you add the <code>language_edit</code> parameter!</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>An authentication dialog will open - enter the <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> shown above.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/authentication.png" alt="Authentication">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Authentication</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>If you allow your browser to store the username and password, you will not have to enter them again for any page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>You will now see a Translation Editor Panel in the upper-left corner of the page - you can use this panel to edit the page title or to turn off the translation editor.

          </figure>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>General Editing</h3>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>You will see edit icons beside blocks of text that can be edited:
          <ul>
            <li><img src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/green-edit-icon.png" alt="Green Edit Icon"> (Green edit icon means this text is the original machine translation)</li>
            <li><img src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/red-edit-icon.png" alt="Red Edit Icon"> (Red edit icon means that this text has been edited by someone)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Clicking either of these icons will open the corresponding text block in a dialog that shows both the English text and the translated text, and allow you to modify the translation.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/edit-dialog.png" alt="Editing Dialog">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Editing Dialog</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="paragraphs">A Special Case: Paragraphs</h3>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Editing paragraphs (only, unfortunately) is a special case. You will see two icons to the left of the paragraph.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/edit-paragraph-icons.png" alt="Edit Paragraph Icons">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Edit Paragraph Icons</figcaption>
          </figure>
            <p>Clicking the icon on the left allows you to edit the entire paragraph, allowing some reordering.</p>
            <figure class="bcls-figure">
              <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/edit-paragraph.png" alt="Edit Paragraph">
              <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Edit Paragraph</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
        <li>Note that when you edit a whole paragraph, the dialog will show the HTML tags as well as text. It is generally <strong>not</strong> a good idea to edit the HTML tags unless you are really sure you know what you are doing.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/edit-paragraph-dialog.png" alt="Paragraph Editing">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Paragraph Editing</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Editing URLs</h3>
      <p>By default, Google Translate will translate the path in the URL in links. <strong>This is a bad thing,</strong> because although the link will work, if the user follows the link to the new page, and then tries to change the language back to English, they will go to a Page Not Found page (the technical reason is complicated, but if you really want to know, ask <a href="mailto:rcrooks@brightcove.com">Robert</a>). However, you can edit URLs to fix this, as explained in the steps below.</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>To the right of most links, you will see an Edit URL icon.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/edit-url-icon.png" alt="Edit URL Icon">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Edit URL Icon</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>When you click the icon you will be able to edit the URL path that is used for the link.
          <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="//docs.brightcove.com/en/test/images/edit-url-dialog.png" alt="Edit URL Dialog">
            <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Edit URL Dialog</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>Either the English or the translated URL path may appear in the dialog, but <strong>what you want to save is the English</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
