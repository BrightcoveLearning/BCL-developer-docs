      <h1>Editing Translations</h1>
      <h2>What you need to know:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>URL parameter to enable the translation editor: <code>?language_edit=1</code></li>
        <li>username: <code>dev-54ta5gq-6sglloa4yrkti</code></li>
        <li>password: <code>s69bHkr7</code></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>IMPORTANT: Before you begin</h2>
      <p>If the problem (or part of it) is things translated that should not be (such as product names or code), <strong>it is better to fix that in the English source rather than edit the translation.</strong> Just submit a KNOW ticket indicating the page URL, and whether the issue is product names, code, or something else. The Learning Services team will fix it.</p>
      <h3>Limitations of the editor</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Every HTML tag is treated as a separate editable block. That means you can only make changes within that block, and you cannot change the order of blocks. Also, if you delete the translated text in a block entirely, the existing translation will be used.</li>
        <li>The Neural Network (the artificial intelligence part of the system) is both a help and an obstacle:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Good</strong>: when you change one instance of a mis-translated phrase, you should see other instances on the same page automatically changed. In a day or two, you will also see the same correction automatically made in other pages.</li>
          <li><strong>The Bad</strong>: it is not totally reliable, though. It sometimes misses fixing instances, I think because they are in a different kind of tag (a list item rather than a paragraph, for example).</li>
          <li><strong>The Ugly</strong>: worse than missing some, it is an all or nothing game. The change will be made everywhere, even if you do not want it to be. For example, there is no way to specify that "Audience" should not be translated when it is used a product name, but should be translated if it is used as a ordinary word. You have to choose what is the less bad thing to do in those cases.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Open a KNOW ticket (via JIRA or email to docs@brightcove.com) indicating what page you are going to edit, so that you can assign the changes to a reviewer when you're finished</li>
        <li>Open the page in your browser in the language you want to edit.</li>
        <li>Add the URL param <code>?language_edit=1</code> to the end of the URL, and press <strong>return</strong> to reload the page.
