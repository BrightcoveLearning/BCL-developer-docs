        <div class="section" id="support">
          <h2>Support</h2>
          <p>Support for the SDK is available via <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/contact/create">Brightcove Support</a> and also a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brightcove-native-player-sdks">Google Group for the Player SDKs</a>.</p>
          <h3>Supported versions</h3>
          <p>Support is defined in terms of the [major version].[minor version].[minor revision] of an OS (for example: Android 4.1.1). There are two levels of support</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Active: Brightcove will test and fix bugs on these OS versions.</li>
              <li>Passive: Brightcove will test on these OS versions, but bug fixes will be handled on a case by case basis.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Generally, Brightcove provides active support for the versions of the OS that are used by 80% of the user base, and passive support for other versions used by at least 5% of the user base. Only the latest minor revision of a version is supported.</p>
          <p>Brightcove provides active support for the latest Android SDK on the following Android versions:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>4.4</li>
              <li>4.3</li>
              <li>4.2</li>
              <li>4.1</li>
              <li>4.0</li>
              <li>2.3</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="section" id="installation">
          <h2>Core SDK Installation</h2>
          <p>Installation of the core SDK is very straightforward. You simply download the SDK and unzip it. As mentioned above, you will find the SDK archive file contains six other zip files. Unzip the <strong>android-sdk-4.x.x.zip</strong> file.  From this archive add the <strong>android-sdk-4.x.x.jar</strong> file to your library.</p>
        </div>
                <div class="section" id="architectureoverview">
                  <h2>Architectural overview</h2>
                  <p>The Brightcove Player SDK for Android is built on top of existing Android tools to simplify the use of video on Android and ease the use of Video Cloud assets, like videos and playlists. The SDK is designed around an event driven architecture where components emit events to allow other components to listen and respond to state changes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="architecturalcomponents">
                  <h2>Architectural components</h2>
                  <p>Below is a list of important architectural components to help you understand the SDK.</p>
          <h3>Brightcove Player</h3>
          <p>The class <code>BrightcovePlayer</code> is a basic Activity, which wraps a <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> and sets up an <code>EventLogger</code> and default <code>MediaController</code>.   It implements basic lifecycle management and full screen logic.  It is meant to be subclassed.  At a minimum the <code>onCreate()</code> should be overridden with logic to wire up the BrightcoveVideoView variable to the layout.xml. For example:</p>
          <pre><code>brightcoveVideoView = (BrightcoveVideoView) findViewById(R.id.bc_video_view);</code></pre>
          <h3>Brightcove Video View</h3>
          <p>The class <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> is an Android widget and a lower level alternative to the <code>BrightcovePlayer</code>.  It is designed to be drop in replacement for Android's native <code>VideoView</code>. It provides public methods to mirror that of VideoView and Java collection-like API for managing the internal playlist. It is designed to use the Event workflow and will emit events related to video playback.</p>
          <p>The <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> is designed to work with Android's <code>MediaController</code> class to provide a controller for video playback that matches the device and OS version.</p>
          <h3>Events</h3>
          <p>Events in the Brightcove Player SDK for Android represent a state or action that can be passed down through a chain of listeners. All events have a type, and a map of properties associated with them. Events can also be stopped from propagating down the chain of listeners, or can be instructed to prevent their default listeners in the video playback classes. Events can represent state or an action occurring. For example, the event type <code>DID_SEEK_TO</code> represents the state of the action <code>SEEK_TO</code>.</p>
          <h3>EventEmitter</h3>
          <p>The <code>EventEmitter</code> is the public facing API for classes that wish to emit and listen to events. The event emitter can be obtained from the <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code>. It is also possible to create your own event emitter and instruct the <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> to use it. This would be useful if you want control of the chain of listeners.</p>.
          <h3>Components</h3>
          <p>Components in the Brightcove Player SDK for Android are objects that can use events and the event emitter system. Using a subclass of <code>AbstractComponent</code> will allow you to quickly create a component that listens for and emits events. As a component, you must describe in annotations which events the component will listen for and emit.</p>
          <h3>Catalog</h3>
          <p>The Catalog provides access to Video Cloud videos and playlists. This component's methods allow retrieval of videos and playlists by ID and/or ReferenceID.  The catalog will make the URL requests and parse the returned data.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="analytics">
				    <h2>Analytics</h2>
				    <p>If you use the Brightcove player and Catalog included in the SDK to retrieve and play videos, analytics data will be automatically collected and will appear in your Video Cloud Analytics. If you do not use the Brightcove player and catalog, you can still send analytics data to your Video Cloud Analytics using the <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/analytics-api/guides/data-collection-api-overview.html">Data Collection API</a>.</p>
				</div>
        <div class="section" id="knownissues">
          <h2>Known issues</h2>
          <h3>GEO restriction feature</h3>
          <p>The GEO restriction feature does not work with the Brightcove Player SDK for Android.</p>
          <h3>loadVideoBy* mixed results when in full screen playback</h3>
          <p>If you call <code>videoPlayer.loadVideoBy*()</code> while you are in full screen playback the current video stops but you stay in full screen. If you exit full screen you see the new video is cued. This can happen if these methods are called asynchronously.</p>
