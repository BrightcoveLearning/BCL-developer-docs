<h2 class="BCL-conceptTitle">Workflow for creating HDS remote video assets</h2>
<p>Below are some special considerations for creating <a href="#vod">HDS VOD</a> and <a href="#live">live streaming</a> assets.</p>
<p>NOTE: if you plan to use the Brightcove native player SDKs to create video-enabled apps for iOS and Android, you MUST use the method explained in <a href="internal:node/460#HDS_HLS">https://support.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/docs/creating-videos-remote-assets-using-media-api</a></p>
<div class="BCL-subsection">
<h3 class="BCL-subsectionTitle"><a name="vod"></a>VOD assets</h3>
<p>For URLs to SMIL files, enter the URL including the SMIL extension, do not use the any path information past the SMIL extension, if it exists. For example, in the following URL:</p>
<pre>
http://zerihdndemo-f.akamaihd.net/z/h264/robinhood/robinhood.smil/manifest.f4m</pre>
<p>use the following URL in creating your remote asset in Video Cloud via Studio or the Media API:</p>
<pre>
http://zerihdndemo-f.akamaihd.net/z/h264/robinhood/robinhood.smil</pre>
<p>For URLs containing MP4 or F4V extensions, if the URL contains all of the rendition information in a single URL, the entire URL including the SMIL (or CSMIL extension) can be used to create a remote video through the Media Module or Media API.  All path information past the SMIL/CSMIL extension can be discarded. For example, a URL like this:</p>
<pre>
http://multiplatform-f.akamaihd.net/z/multi/april11/hdworld/
  hdworld_,512x288_450_b,640x360_700_b,768x432_1000_b,1024x576_1400_m,
  1280x720_1900_m,1280x720_2500_m,1280x720_3500_m,.mp4.csmil/manifest.f4m</pre>
the URL should be trimmed to exclude everything past the .csmil extension.
<p class="BCL-aside">However, this is not the optimal use case, since asset URLs support a maximum of 250 characters.  Using a single URL with information for several renditions can exceed this limit, and will throw an error.  Using a single URL also creates a single asset record, and may affect rendition selection.</p>
<p>The optimum way to create a video with multiple renditions is to use individual asset URLs to create remote renditions. If the only URL available contains all rendition information (as in the example above), the URL can be edited into separate rendition URLs.</p>
<p>Here is the typical procedure. Assume a video URL like this:</p>
<pre>
http://multiplatform-f.akamaihd.net/z/multi/april11/hdworld/hdworld_,
512x288_450_b,640x360_700_b,768x432_1000_b,1024x576_1400_m,
1280x720_1900_m,1280x720_2500_m,1280x720_3500_m,.mp4.csmil/manifest.f4m
</pre>
<p>Do the following to create the individual rendition URLs:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use the URL up to the first comma as the URL base</li>
    <li>Append the rendition information (for example, the &ldquo;512x288_450_b&rdquo; in the example above) and the video file type (in the example above, &ldquo;.mp4&rdquo;) to the URL base for the first rendition.  The first rendition, from the example above, would be:<br />
    <pre>
http://multiplatform-f.akamaihd.net/z/multi/april11/hdworld/hdworld_,512x288_450_b.mp4</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Repeat the step 2 for each rendition described in the URL.  In the example above, Seven renditions would be created for the remote video</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="BCL-subsection">
<h3 class="BCL-subsectionTitle"><a name="live"></a>Live Video</h3>
<p>For a URL formatted like this: <code>http://multiformatlive-f.akamaihd.net/z/demostream_1@2131/manifest.f4m</code>, use the URL up to the &ldquo;manifest.f4m&rdquo; file path to configure the live stream.  In the example above, the live stream URL to use in creating the remote video would be:</p>
<p><code>http://multiformatlive-f.akamaihd.net/z/demostream_1@2131</code></p>
<p>The (live feed) stream name for encoders should follow the format of <strong>[EVENT_ANGLE_BITRATE]@StreamID</strong> while <strong>[EVENT_ANGLE]@StreamID</strong> should be used as the playback URL in remote video assets.</p>
<p>Note that the frame size and bitrates are not required, as those are detected by Akamai and are put in the generated manifest file automatically. Be sure your final stream includes the <strong>/z/</strong> directory and not the<strong> /i/</strong> directory so our player can select the appropriate streams.</p>
