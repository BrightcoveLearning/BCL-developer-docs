                    <p>This topic explains how bandwidth is used - and wasted - by online video, and things you can do to reduce wasted bandwidth.</p>
                </header>
                <section id="background" class="bcls-section">
                    <h2>Video bandwidth</h2>
                    <p>Like any other digital asset, a video is delivered over the internet to browsers and apps as data. The amount of data transferred is the bandwidth consumed, and you are charged for. This bandwidth can be divided into two kinds:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Used bandwidth: the data associated with part(s) of the video that the viewer watches</li>
                        <li>Wasted bandwidth: data associated with part(s) of the video that are downloaded, but not actually viewed - some bandwidth is almost always wasted because:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Video data is <em>buffered</em> ahead of the viewing progress, so that video won't keep pausing while additional data is downloaded</li>
                                <li>Devices, by default, <em>preload</em> part or all of the video data (depending on the video format) before the viewer tries to play it - the reason for this is that network bandwidth available to devices is often less than what's available to computer, and therefore preloading allows the video to start playing more quickly when the viewer taps the play button</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We can further identify, in some cases, a portion of the used bandwidth that we'll call <strong>excessive bandwidth</strong>. Excessive bandwidth is consumed when a high quality rendition of the video is viewed, but is indistinguishable to the viewer from a lower quality rendition. This occurs when the size and/or visual resolution of the video rendition is greater than the viewer's screen supports.</p>
                    <h3>Increasing bandwidth</h3>
                    <p>If you have been a Video Cloud customer for some time, you have probably seen the amount of video bandwidth consumed (and the associated costs) for your account(s) increase. There are several reasons why this happens:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>More viewers:</strong> overall, the number of people who connect to the internet through computers and/or devices is increasing, and they also watch increasing amounts of video online. Of course, this is a global increase and varies over particular sites and apps. You can tell whether you have more viewers using Video Cloud Analytics, looking at such metrics as video impressions, video views, and unique users.</li>
                        <li><strong>More internet bandwidth:</strong> thanks to improvements in the infrastructure and network protocols that support the internet, internet users on the average have more available bandwidth (again, this is a global average, and there are local variations). This has two implications for online video:
                            <ul>
                                <li>more video data can get downloaded faster, whether the user views the video or not</li>
                                <li>faster download times mean that higher quality renditions can be viewed in many cases</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Internet usage is shifting toward devices:</strong> and this includes consumption of online video. This tends to increase bandwidth consumption because of the preloading behavior described above.</li>
                        <li><strong>Changes in Video Cloud:</strong> the most significant change here is the introduction of Ingest Profiles, which give you greater flexibility in the sets of renditions you create for different kinds of video. The standard ingest profiles, and many of custom profiles created by customers like you, include higher quality renditions than those provided in the standard transcode settings for the old Studio. This was a deliberate change to accomodate the general increase in internet bandwidth described above.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>To the extent that these factors increase <em>used bandwidth,</em> that is probably a good thing, as it likely means that you have more viewers watching better quality renditions of your video. These increases inevitably mean an increase in wasted bandwidth as well, however, and it may be that the amount of increased wastage is significant enough that you would like to reduce it if possible. The sections of the topic that follow discuss the various factors that affect bandwidth consumption, and options you have that might reduce wasted bandwidth if you wish to.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="File_type" class="bcls-section">
                    <h2>File type</h2>
                    <p>In the post-Flash world, video files are delivered to browsers and devices over HTTP connections, and the file type determines how this is done. MP4 renditions are delivered as whole files, while time-segemented renditions (HLS or DASH) are delivered in short segments as they are needed. The difference can have a significant impact on wasted bandwidth, especially on devices that preload the video. If the viewer stays on the page or app view long enough, an entire MP4 rendition will be downloaded, even if none of it is watched. HLS renditions, on the other hand, are generally broken up into 10 second segments, so in the same scenario, only the first 10 seconds worth of video data would be downloaded.</p>
                    <p>It is still worth having MP4 renditions for special situations where HLS cannot be played, but you can significantly reduce wasted bandwidth by ensuring that all of your videos have a good set of HLS renditions (or DASH, if you require DRM types that don't support HLS).</p>
                </section>
                <section id="Preloading" class="bcls-section">
                    <h2>Preloading</h2>
                    <p>As we have already seen, by default most devices will preload the first HLS (or DASH) segment immediately - or an entire MP4 rendition, if no time-segmented rendition is available. The improves the apparently performance of the video, because by the time the viewer tries to play the video, playback will begin immediately. The cost of this is that video bandwidth is consumed even for videos that are rarely or never played. Better performance generally will increase the play rate for the video.</p>
                    <p>Some device operating systems allow preloading to be turned off, so Video Cloud offers you the option to do this in Studio for specific players.</p>
                    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Note that selecting this option will only prevent preloading if the device operating system and/or browser allow this.</aside>
                    <p>Whether you should turn off preloading for some or all players depends on several factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want to maximize video views at all costs, should should leave preloading on.</li>
                        <li>Look at your video analytics - videos with very low play rates are the worst offenders for wasting bandwidth, so consider turning off preloading for players that deliver these videos.</li>
                        <li>Turning off preloading is not recommended if you have several players on the same page.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="Buffering" class="bcls-section">
                    <h2>Buffering</h2>
                    <p>The Brightcove player automatically buffers video during playback - this means that additional future segments of a video are downloaded to prevent the video from pausing while additional data is downloaded when the end of a segment is reached. By default, the player tries to maintain of buffer of thirty seconds of video ahead of the current playback position.</p>
                    <p>Bandwidth waste due to buffering is proporionally greater for short videos. Consider, for example, a one minute video of which, on the average, thirty seconds are viewed. For every view, then, as much bandwidth is wasted as is used.</p>
