<p>This topic describes how to create, update, or delete <a href="internal:node/1045#playlist">playlists</a> using the Media API.</p>
<p>The Media API contains a set of write methods you can use to create, update, or delete playlists:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#create"><span style="font-family: Courier New;">create_playlist</span></a></li>
    <li><a href="#update"><span style="font-family: Courier New;">update_playlist</span></a></li>
    <li><a href="#delete"><span style="font-family: Courier New;">delete_playlist</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These methods work much like <span style="font-family: Courier New;">create_video</span> and the other write methods that affect videos, images, and logo overlays.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For an introduction to the Media API, read <a href="internal:node/1346">Getting Started with the Media API</a>.</li>
    <li>For reference information about these methods, read the <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/media/index.html">Media API Reference</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video Cloud provides three different approaches to creating and managing playlists:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="internal:node/580">the Media module</a></li>
    <li><a href="internal:node/560#create_update_lineups">FTP batch provisioning</a></li>
    <li>the Media API, as described in this topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="create"></a>create_playlist method</h2>
<p>The <span style="font-family: Courier New;">create_playlist</span>&nbsp;method works much like <span style="font-family: Courier New;">create_video</span>; you need to set up the JSON that represents your playlist object, along with the Media API method name and write token for your account, and then post it to the URL for the Video Cloud Media API.</p>
<p>The <a href="internal:node/458#Playlist">Media API&nbsp;Objects Reference</a> describes the properties of the Playlist object that you create or modify with the Playlist Write methods. The following properties are required when you create a playlist:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: Courier New;">name</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: Courier New;">playlistType</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a manual playlist</h3>
<p>If the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New;">playlistType</span>&nbsp;property in the Playlist object you submit is <span style="font-family: Courier New;">explicit</span>, that means it's a manual playlist. When you create a manual playlist, you need to include a <span style="font-family: Courier New;">videoIds</span> parameter, which is a list of the video IDs to include in the playlist. Note that you must refer to videos in the playlist by their video ID, not their reference ID. You may choose&nbsp; to assemble this list with a previous <span style="font-family: Courier New;">search_videos</span> or <span style="font-family: Courier New;">find_videos</span> Media API read call.</p>
<h3>Creating a smart playlist</h3>
<p>If&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; ">playlistType</span>&nbsp;property in the Playlist object you submit is&nbsp;not <span style="font-family: Courier New;">explicit</span> , that means it's a smart playlist. In that case, the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">playlistType</span> will specify how the videos are ordered. You can optionally use the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">filterTags</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">tagInclusionRule</span> parameters to limit the videos on your smart playlist. You can specify that the playlist includes only the videos that contain all the tags listed in the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">filterTags</span> parameter (by setting the  <span style="font-family: Courier New;">tagInclusionRule</span> parameter to AND), or only the videos that contain at least one of the tags listed in the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">filterTags</span> parameter (by setting the  <span style="font-family: Courier New;">tagInclusionRule</span> parameter to OR).</p>
<h3>create_playlist PHP example</h3>
<p>In this PHP example, we are creating a smart playlist that will consist of all videos that have both of the tags <span style="font-family: Courier New;">crescent</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">gibbous</span>:</p>
<pre class="code-java">
curl -F &quot;json={'method' : 'create_playlist',\
'params':{\
'token':'insertTokenHere.',\
'playlist':{\
'referenceId':'moonshot-1',\
'name':'Phases 3 and 4',\
'shortDescription':'The moon as it wanes from gibbous to crescent.',\
'playlistType':'ALPHABETICAL',\
'filterTags':['crescent','gibbous'],\
'tagInclusionRule': 'AND'}\
}}&quot; http://api.brightcove.com/services/post</pre>
<h2><a name="update"></a>update_playlist method</h2>
<p>The <span style="font-family: Courier New;">update_playlist</span> method is useful for modifying playlists that already exist. It is very similar to the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">create_playlist</span> method. You need to set up the JSON that represents your playlist object, along  with the Media API method name and write token for your account, and  then post it to the URL for the Video Cloud Media API. Since the playlist already exists, it has a read-only <span style="font-family: Courier New;">id</span> property (returned by the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">create_playlist</span> method), and also a <span style="font-family: Courier New;">referenceId</span>, if you set that optional property. You can refer to the playlist you want to update either by the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">id</span> property or by the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">referenceId</span> property. However, if you want to change the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">referenceId</span> property, you must include the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">id</span> property. Note that if you refer  to videos in the playlist , you must use their video ID, not their reference ID, in the Playlist object's <span style="font-family: Courier New;">videoIds</span> property.</p>
<p>Any property that you list in your JSON Playlist object will be overwritten with the value you pass in the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">update_playlist</span> method. Any properties you omit will retain their existing values. For example, if you have a manual playlist that consists of 4 videos, 1234, 1235, 1236, and 1237, and you want to append a new video with the ID 2001 to the end of the playlist, you need to pass the IDs of all 5 videos, in JSON like this:</p>
<pre>
{&quot;method&quot;:&quot;update_playlist&quot;,
&quot;params&quot;:{
    &quot;token&quot;:&quot;insertTokenHere&quot;,
    &quot;playlist&quot;:{
        &quot;id&quot;:&quot;25855448001&quot;,
        &quot;videoIds&quot;:[1234, 1235, 1236, 1237, 2001]
        }
    }
} </pre>
<h2><a name="delete"></a>delete_playlist method</h2>
<p>The <span style="font-family: Courier New;">delete_playlist</span> method is quite simple; you just pass the playlist ID or reference ID of the playlist you want to delete, along with your Media API write token. There is also an optional <span style="font-family: Courier New;">cascade</span> parameter; set this to true if you want to delete this playlist even if it is referenced by players. With <span style="font-family: Courier New;">cascade=&quot;true&quot;</span>, the playlist will be removed from all players in which it appears, then deleted.</p>
<h3>delete_playlist JavaScript example</h3>
<p>This example presents a form that takes the playlist's ID and uses the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">delete_playlist</span> method to delete the playlist when user clicks the Delete button. It also displays the JSON request that is passed and the response (which is void, if the request succeeds).</p>
<pre>
function buildJSONRequest(){
    if(document.getElementById('id').value ==&quot;&quot;){
        alert(&quot;Please enter a playlist ID&quot;);
        return;
    }else
    {
        json = document.getElementById('JSONView');
        //Construct the JSON request:
        json.value = '{&quot;method&quot;: &quot;delete_playlist&quot;, &quot;params&quot;:{&quot;playlist_id&quot;:
        '+ document.getElementById('id').value +
        ',&quot;token&quot;: &quot;'+ document.getElementById(&quot;insertTokenHere.&quot;).value + '&quot;}}';
    }
}</pre>
<p>The <span style="font-family: Courier New;">doPlaylistDelete</span> function calls the <span style="font-family: Courier New;">buildJSONRequest</span> function:&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
function doPlaylistDelete(){
    form = document.getElementById(&quot;delete_playlist_sample&quot;);
    buildJSONRequest();
    form.action = document.getElementById(&quot;yourAPILocation&quot;).value;
    form.submit();
}</pre>
