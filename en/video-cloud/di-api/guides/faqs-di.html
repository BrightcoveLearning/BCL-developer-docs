				<h2>FAQs</h2>
				<p class="bcls-question">What are the limits?</p>
					<ul class="bcls-answer">
					    <li>API Request: Unlimited</li>
					    <li>Number of jobs processing simultaneously: Unlimited</li>
					    <li>File size: Unlimited</li>
					</ul>
				<p class="bcls-question">What are the supported input formats?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">The DI API supports 99.9% of all input formats.  Virtually every significant format over the last 30 years is supported by our platform. While most formats are supported, certain variations of formats will not produce consistent results.  Foldered .mxf files with multiple audio and video tracks over various timeframes, edit-list based mp4s, and video formats with multiple audio tracks are not supported.  Where possible, the files will be ingest by applying the rule of selecting the first video track and the first audio track.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">How fast is Dynamic Ingest?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">Dynamic Ingest is a horizontally scalable, cloud transcoding solution that processes all of your content in parallel.  Because of this, we generally see transcoding times at faster than real time.  Depending on how quickly Dynamic Ingest can download the file from your storage location, an unlimited number of jobs can process at a highly consistent rate.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">What region is Dynamic Ingest located in?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">Currently, Dynamic Ingest workers are running in the AWS US East region.  Any content hosted in S3 buckets in that region can be downloaded with no egress charge.  Content hosted on other cloud providers or in other regions may incur an egress cost with your cloud provider.  In the future, we plan to enable this technology to run in any of the current AWS regions.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">Is DRM supported?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">At launch, Dynamic Ingest will not support DRM.  We plan to add DRM support by January 2015.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">Why pull files instead of uploading?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">Legacy Video Cloud Ingest methods all supported some form of push - Media API, Batch FTP, and Aspera.  Uploading works well for certain use cases, but pull has significant advantages.  Since a job request consists only of a URL to the file, any file corruption or transfer issues can be solved by automatically retrying the job.  Downloading files allows Brightcove to horizontally scale the platform - instead of funneling all traffic through an FTP or HTTP post server, downloads can occur on the same worker that performs the transcoding.  When files are hosted on cloud storage, the scale becomes truly astounding, a virtually limitless number of jobs can be run in parallel.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">Is Dynamic Ingest secure?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">Security is a paramount concern for Brightcove.  Dynamic Ingest supports secure transport methods - sftp, https, or bucket policies with S3.  By using these methods, the transfer to retrieve a source file is secured.  Once in the cloud, if the decision is made not to store the master, the master file is hosted on transcoding workers and deleted immediately after the transcode is completed.  File names are hashed and never revealed.  The same security policies maintained by Zencoder are used for the transcode process, and in over 4 years of operations, no file has ever been compromised on the Zencoder platform.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">Where is the service located?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">For the initial release of Dynamic Ingest, the service is running in the AWS US-East region.  Ingest requests coming from S3 within that region will not incur an egress charge.  Over the course of the coming months, we will continue to add more regions.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">Can I integrate Dynamic Ingest with my existing workflow?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">Dynamic Ingest is designed to work alongside the other existing ingest methods.  Media API, Batch FTP, and Aspera ingest will all work as expected alongside Dynamic Ingest.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">How long does it take to integrate with Dynamic Ingest?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">Integrating with the API is incredibly easy - it should take between 2-7 days to have a complete, robust integration.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">What if our data center doesn't allow external access?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">There are a number of ways to deal with this.  Dynamic Ingest supports secure transfer methods, so it’s possible to open a single, secure entry point into the data center.  It’s also possible to build a workflow that pushes content to a cloud storage provider, triggers the ingest, then deletes the content.</p>
				<p class="bcls-question">How much does Dynamic Ingest cost?</p>
				<p class="bcls-answer">Dynamic Ingest billing is the same as existing methods.</p>
