          <!-- content starts here -->
            <p>The Brightcove Native Player SDKs are not video players themselves. Instead, they can be seen as integration points with advertising, analytics and digital rights management and closed captioning.</p>
            <p>The Brightcove SDKs are built on top of native player frameworks. This allows you to take advantage of the speed, performance, and flexibility of the native OS, and extend it into a complete video experience that is easy to integrate. In addition, the Brightcove SDKs follow established conventions for memory, naming, and design patterns in order to make getting started as simple as possible.

            <p>The Brightcove SDK for iOS is built on top of existing iOS tools, simplifying video playback and feature integrations.</p>

            <h3>Analytics</h3>
            <p>If you use the Brightcove player and the <code>Catalog</code> class included in the SDK to retrieve and play videos, analytics data will be automatically collected and will appear in your Video Cloud Analytics.</p>
            <p>If you override the <code>BCOVVideo</code> class or do not use the Brightcove player and catalog, you need to send your Publisher ID to Video Cloud Analytics.</p>

            <h2><a name="androidarchitecture"></a>Android architecture</h2>
            <p>The Brightcove Native SDK for Android simplifies integration of video playback with Brightcove Video Cloud and many popular advertising, analytics, and DRM solutions. It also provides closed captioning support for pre-KitKat devices and easily customizable player controls with similar look and feel to the Brightcove Web Player to provide a consistent user experience across platforms.</p>
            
            <div><img src="assets/android-architecture.png" alt="Android Architecture"></div>
		    <p>The <code>BaseVideoView</code> subclasses, including <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code>, are intended to be drop-in replacements for Android's <code>VideoView</code> widget.</p>
		  	<p>The <code>BaseVideoView</code> has the following subclasses:</p>
		  	<ul>
			  <li><code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> - uses the <code>SurfaceView</code> for rendering</li>
			  <li><code>BrightcoveTextureVideoView</code> - uses the <code>TextureView</code> for rendering</li>
			  <li><code>SeamlessVideoView</code> - wraps a VisualOn player for HLS videos</li>
			  <li><code>BrightcoveExoPlayerVideoView</code> - uses Google's Exo Player and the <code>SurfaceView</code> for rendering</li>
		  	</ul>
		  	
            
            <h3>Analytics</h3>
            <p>If you use the Brightcove player and the <code>Catalog</code> class included in the SDK to retrieve and play videos, analytics data will be automatically collected and will appear in your Video Cloud Analytics.</p>
			<p>When not using the <code>Catalog</code> to create <code>Video</code> or <code>Playlist</code> objects for playback, the Analytics component's <code>account</code> property must be manually set.</p>
			
            <p>For details about sending data to Video Cloud Analytics, see the <a href="brightcove-player-sdk-for-android/guides/analytics/analytics.html">Using Brightcove Analytics</a> guide.</p>
            
            <h3>VisualOn</h3>
			<p>When using the HLS Player (<code>SeamlessVideoView</code>) on Amazon devices, which include a VisualOn license, Brightcove Analytics adjusts accordingly to avoid double billing.</p>
			
        </div>
            
        <div class="section" id="androidcomponents">
            <h2>Android components</h2>
            <p>Below is a list of important architectural components to help you understand the SDK.</p>
            <h3>Brightcove Player</h3>
            <p>The 
                <code>BrightcovePlayer</code> class is a basic Activity, which wraps a
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> and sets up an
                <code>EventLogger</code> and default
                <code>MediaController</code>. It implements basic lifecycle management and full screen logic. It is meant to be subclassed.</p> 
            <p>At a minimum the
                <code>onCreate()</code> method should be overridden with logic to wire up the <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> variable to the <strong>layout.xml</strong> file. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>brightcoveVideoView = (BrightcoveVideoView) findViewById(R.id.bc_video_view);</code></pre>
            
            <h3>Brightcove Video View</h3>
			
			<p>The <code>BaseVideoView</code> subclasses, like <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code>, can be used outside a <code>BrightcovePlayer</code> or <code>BrightcovePlayerFragment</code>, but require life cycle management and full screen support to be implemented by the developer.</p>	
			
            <p>The
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> class is designed to replace Android's native
                <code>VideoView</code>. It provides public methods to mirror that of <code>VideoView</code> and is a Java collection-like API for managing the internal playlist. It uses the Event workflow and will emit events related to video playback.</p>
            <p>The
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> class is designed to work with Android's
                <code>MediaController</code> class to provide a controller for video playback that matches the device and OS version.</p>
            
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>Events in the Brightcove Player SDK for Android represent a state or action that can be passed down through a chain of listeners. All events have a type and a map of properties associated with them. Events can be stopped from propagating down the chain of listeners, or can be instructed to prevent their default listeners in the video playback classes.</p>
            <p>Events can represent state or an action occurring. For example, the event type
                <code>DID_SEEK_TO</code> represents the state of the action
                <code>SEEK_TO</code>.</p>
            
            <h3>EventEmitter</h3>
            <p>The
                <code>EventEmitter</code> is the public facing API for classes that wish to emit and listen to events. The event emitter can be obtained from the
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code>. It is also possible to create your own event emitter and instruct the
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> to use it. This is useful if you want control of the chain of listeners.</p>
            
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>Components in the Brightcove Player SDK for Android are objects that can use events and the event emitter system. Using a subclass of
                <code>AbstractComponent</code> will allow you to quickly create a component that listens for and emits events. As a component, you must describe in annotations which events the component will listen for and emit.</p>
            
            <h3>Catalog</h3>
            <p>The <code>Catalog</code> provides access to Video Cloud videos and playlists. This component's methods allow retrieval of videos and playlists by <code>ID</code> and/or <code>ReferenceID</code>. The catalog will make the URL requests and parse the returned data.</p>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Access to the Video Cloud videos and playlists are not available to Brightcove Perform customers.</p>
