                </h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Android SDK developer documentation. Here you will find the information needed to develop with the Android SDK.</p>
                <p>At Brightcove, we strive to keep the documentation structured, clean and intuitive. As such, we leverage github READMEs for details on all our plugins and integrations. For your convenience, we've listed and linked to these plugins below.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section" id="support">
                <h2>Supported versions</h2>
                <p>Brightcove provides active support for the latest Android SDK on the following Android versions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5.0</li>
                    <li>4.4</li>
                    <li>4.3</li>
                    <li>4.2</li>
                    <li>4.1</li>
                    <li>4.0</li>
                    <li>2.3.3</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Support is defined in terms of the [major version].[minor version] of an OS (for example: Android 4.1). There are two levels of support</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Active: Brightcove will test and fix bugs on these OS versions.</li>
                    <li>Passive: Brightcove will test on these OS versions, but bug fixes will be handled on a case by case basis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Generally, Brightcove provides active support for the versions of the OS that are used by 80% of the user base, and passive support for other versions used by at least 5% of the user base. Only the latest minor revision of a version is supported.</p>

                <h2>Getting started</h2>
                <p>Before beginning development with the Android SDK there are a few concepts you should learn about:</p>

            <h2>SDK overview</h2>
              
            <p>The Brightcove Native SDK for Android simplifies integration of video playback with Brightcove Video Cloud and many popular advertising, analytics, and DRM solutions. It also provides closed captioning support for pre-KitKat devices and easily customizable player controls with similar look and feel to the Brightcove Web Player to provide a consistent user experience across platforms.</p>
            
            <div><img src="assets/android-architecture.png" alt="Android Architecture"></div>
						<p>The <code>BaseVideoView</code> subclasses are intended to be drop-in replacements for Android's <code>VideoView</code> widget. They are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>BrightcoveVideoView</strong> </li>
							<p>This uses the Android <code>MediaPlayer</code>, similar to Android's <code>VideoView.</code></p>
							<li><strong>BrightcoveTextureVideoView</strong></li>
							<p>This uses the <code>TextureView</code> for rendering.</p>
							<li><strong>SeamlessVideoView</strong></li>
							<p>Also known as the Brightcove HLS Player, the <code>SeamlessVideoView</code> provides greatly improved support for HLS and seamlessly stitching videos together. This is where it gets it's name. The <code>SeamlessVideoView</code> internally uses a VisualOn player, which requires additional native libraries to be included in your app and has additional costs. Please contact your Brightcove account manager for pricing details.</p>
							<li><strong>BrightcoveExoPlayerVideoView</strong></li>
							<p>This uses Google's Exo Player and the <code>SurfaceView</code> for rendering.</p>
						</ul>
            
            <div class="video-cloud-only">
							<h3>Analytics</h3>
							<p>If you use the Brightcove player and the <code>Catalog</code> class included in the SDK to retrieve and play videos, analytics data will be automatically collected and will appear in your Video Cloud Analytics.</p>
							<p>When not using the <code>Catalog</code> to create <code>Video</code> or <code>Playlist</code> objects for playback, the Analytics component's <code>account</code> property must be manually set.</p>
							<p>For details about sending data to Video Cloud Analytics, see the <a href="brightcove-player-sdk-for-android/guides/analytics/analytics.html">Using Brightcove Analytics</a> guide.</p>
							<p class="BCL-aside">When using the HLS Player (<code>SeamlessVideoView</code>) on Amazon devices, which include a VisualOn license, Brightcove Analytics adjusts accordingly to avoid double billing.</p>

					<div class="section" id="sdkcomponents">
            <h2>SDK components</h2>
            <p>Below is a list of important architectural components to help you understand the SDK.</p>
            <h3>Brightcove Player</h3>
            <p>The 
                <code>BrightcovePlayer</code> class is a basic Activity, which wraps a
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> and sets up an
                <code>EventLogger</code> and default
                <code>MediaController</code>. It implements basic lifecycle management and full screen logic. It is meant to be subclassed.</p> 
            <p>At a minimum the
                <code>onCreate()</code> method should be overridden with logic to wire up the <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> variable to the <strong>layout.xml</strong> file. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>brightcoveVideoView = (BrightcoveVideoView) findViewById(R.id.bc_video_view);</code></pre>
            
            <h3>BrightcoveVideoView</h3>
			
						<p>The <code>BaseVideoView</code> subclasses, like <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code>, can be used outside a <code>BrightcovePlayer</code> or <code>BrightcovePlayerFragment</code>, but require life cycle management and full screen support to be implemented by the developer.</p>	
			
            <p>The
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> class is designed to replace Android's native
                <code>VideoView</code>. It provides public methods to mirror that of <code>VideoView</code> and is a Java collection-like API for managing the internal playlist. It uses the Event workflow and will emit events related to video playback.</p>
            <p>The
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> class is designed to work with Android's
                <code>MediaController</code> class to provide a controller for video playback that matches the device and OS version.</p>
            
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>Events in the Brightcove Player SDK for Android represent a state or action that can be passed down through a chain of listeners. All events have a type and a map of properties associated with them. Events can be stopped from propagating down the chain of listeners, or can be instructed to prevent their default listeners in the video playback classes.</p>
            <p>Events can represent state or an action occurring. For example, the event type
                <code>DID_SEEK_TO</code> represents the state of the action
                <code>SEEK_TO</code>.</p>
            
            <h3>EventEmitter</h3>
            <p>The
                <code>EventEmitter</code> is the public facing API for classes that wish to emit and listen to events. The event emitter can be obtained from the
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code>. It is also possible to create your own event emitter and instruct the
                <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> to use it. This is useful if you want control of the chain of listeners.</p>
            
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>Components in the Brightcove Player SDK for Android are objects that can use events and the event emitter system. Using a subclass of
                <code>AbstractComponent</code> will allow you to quickly create a component that listens for and emits events. As a component, you must describe in annotations which events the component will listen for and emit.</p>
            
            <h3>Catalog</h3>
            <p>The <code>Catalog</code> provides access to Video Cloud videos and playlists. This component's methods allow retrieval of videos and playlists by <code>ID</code> and/or <code>ReferenceID</code>. The catalog will make the URL requests and parse the returned data.</p>
            <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Access to the Video Cloud videos and playlists are not available to Brightcove Perform customers.</p>
