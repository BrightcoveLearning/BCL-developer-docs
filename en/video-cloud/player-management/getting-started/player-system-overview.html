        <h1>Brightcove Player System Overview</h1>
        <p>Welcome! Thanks for using the Brightcove player system. The two key components of the system are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Player Management APIs</li>
          <li>The Brightcove player built on Video.js</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Player Management APIs</h2>
        <p>The player management API's features fall into two major categories. Those categories and detailed strengths are listed here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Centralized management</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Automatic version updates</li>
              <li>Create, update and activate players via API</li>
              <li>Update thousands of players at once</li>
              <li>Player versioning and rollback</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Optimized performance</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Pre-compilation of player assets</li>
              <li>Embed thumbnail or video URLs in player</li>
              <li>Deliver plugins through the same CDN</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Brightcove Player</h2>
        <p>Some of the strengths of the Brightcove player are listed here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5 first</li>
          <li>HLS everywhere</li>
          <li>Powerful plugin architecture</li>
          <li>Native player SDKs</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The Brightcove player and the associated APIs provide you with both a lightweight and highly customizable player and a system for deploying players in multiple ways. Below is a high-level workflow diagram to show how the pieces fit together. Following the diagram is an explanation of the parts of the system.

           <h3>Managing players via the Player Management API</h3>
           <p>The <a href="../reference/versions/v1/index.html">Player Management API</a> allows you to create player configurations, which are the specifications for players. You can not only create multiple players, but also can also use the configuration of one player in multiple ways by using child players of a parent player. You can assign different media, styles and plugins to each child player, while still maintaining the parent/child relationship to the original player, so changes made to that player are inherited by all child players. </p>
           <p>Player configurations are created in <em>preview</em> mode, which gives you additional flexibility in choosing when to publish them. Once you are satisfied with changes, you publish the player via a separate API call. Publishing creates a separate branch of the player configuration while retaining the preview branch. This means that you make and test modifications to the preview player and publish it to production only when you are satisfied with the changes.</p>
           <p>Players are usable via a URL, iframe or multiple lines of code placed in a web page. The recommended implementation is the iframe for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sharing videos via social media is easy.</li>
                <li>The player is responsive by default.</li>
                <li>You don't have to worry about collisions between the JavaScript and CSS code for the player and other scripts and styles used in the page.</li>
            </ul>
           <h3>The Brightcove Player</h3>
           <p>The Brightcove player is a lightweight player that loads in HTML5 mode by default, with a fall back to Flash if HTML5 is not supported. Since the default player is HTML5, you can customize using familiar web tools: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It also has an extensive <a href="../../brightcove-player/reference/api/index.html">API</a> and a flexible <a href="../guides/plugin-guide.html">plugin model</a>.</p>
           <h3>The Delivery System API</h3>
           <p>You can simply use the player code returned by the Player Management API in your HTML code to publish your players, but there is also a <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/concepts/delivery-system-api/guides/dev-system-api-overview.html">Delivery System API</a> that gives you some some additional flexibility.</p>
             <p>The Delivery System API is an interface for a Git system. It is used by the Player Management API to set up repositories for your players, and in many cases, there will be no need to interact with the repos directly. However, you can use it to add additional HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the player embed and publish the whole code together.</p>

      <div class="section" id="detailedDocumentation">
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <h3>The APIs</h3>
        <p>Our APIs are built as RESTful APIs. If you don&#39;t know what this refers to, you may want to read <a href="//net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/a-beginners-introduction-to-http-and-rest/">this article</a>.</p>
        <p>The <a href="player-mgmt-api-overview.html">Player Management API Overview</a> explains a set of APIs that allow you create and alter your players outside of a Brightcove-built UI.</p>
        <p>The <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/concepts/delivery-system-api/guides/dev-system-api-overview.html">Delivery System API Overview</a> explains a second set of APIs that allow fine-grained control over your players, altering all the files that are delivered for a player.</p>
        <h3>The Brightcove Player</h3>
        <p>The <a href="../../brightcove-player/reference/api/index.html">Player API</a> explains the currently available player APIs. There are also several guides (see the Player Guides menu at the top of the page) to help you understand and work with the player.</p>
        <p>There's also a detailed document on <a href="../../brightcove-player/guides/https-overview.html">HTTPS support</a>.</p>
        <h3>Player plugins</h3>
        <p>To customize your player, you use plugins. Some plugins are provided by Brightcove, some from the open source video.js community or you can write them yourself. Get started with plugins from the <a href="../guides/plugin-dev-quick-start.html">Quick Start to Plugin Development</a>.</p>
