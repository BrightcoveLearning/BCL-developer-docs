          <h1>Quick Start to Player Management</h1>
          <p>In this quick start you will perform the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a Node.js application to act as your OAuth security proxy. This proxy will use your access token to make calls to the needed APIs.</li>
            <li>Obtain credentials to use the Content Management System (CMS) API.</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>a</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="BCL-aside">For details on the API used in this document you can view the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/cms-api/guides/overview-cms.html">Content Management System API Overview</a> document and the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/cms-api/reference/versions/v1/index.html">Content Management System API</a> reference.</p>
          <p class="text-warning">Note: The steps in the document involve curl and other command-line tools that are native to Mac and Linux systems, but not part of the Windows operating system. If you are on Windows, you can get these tools by installing <a href="//cygwin.com">cygwin</a>. During the install you will be prompted for packages to install. Open the <strong>Net</strong> package, then check the <strong>curl</strong> option and then finish the installation. Once you have done this you will be able to follow the Quick Start to the Content Management System successfully as written using the cygwin command line. Tools are available to run curl at the normal Windows command line, but not detailed in this document.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="oauthproxy" class="section">
          <h2>Create proxy</h2>
          <p>Security on the Player Management API uses OAuth2. This requires some work to access the API. </p>
          <ol>
          <li>In this quick start it is recommended you set up a Node.js application to act as a proxy. The <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/oauth-api/guides/quick-start.html">OAuth Quick Start</a> guides you through the steps to create a basic proxy in Node.js that gets an access token for a Brightcove API, makes the API call, and then returns the response data.</li>
          <li>You will also need a local web server running to serve up a testing page, <strong>tester.html</strong>, which works with the proxy. Note that simply browsing the page as a file will NOT work as the page utilizes an iframe, which requires an HTTP server.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="obtaincredentials" class="section">
          <h2>Obtain credentials</h2>
          <p>To use the CMS API you will need proper credentials. Later in this quick start, you will use the credentials in a form when submitting requests to APIs.</p> 
          <ol start="3">
            <li>To obtain proper credentials use your choice of these two options (Be sure to read the paragraph following the bullets to ensure you ask for the proper operations):</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
              <li><a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/oauth-api/guides/get-client-credentials.html">OAuth: Get Client Credentials Using CURL</a></li>

          </ul>
          <p>Whichever option you choose, you will need to ask for the correct operation permissions. In this quick start you will need both <strong>video</strong> and <strong>ingest-profile</strong> operations. The following can be used with curl or Postman to get the proper permissions:</p>

In this case we will provide a thumbnail/poster image that appears before the video begins playing, as well as add an HLS formatted video to the sources. The HLS video is listed first for a reason, as the player will attempt to play that particular video format first. If that fails, the player will fall back to the MP4 version.</p>

          <p>In this case you will use a very simple pre-existing plugin to overlay a text message on the video. Following is the code for a plugin that creates an HTML paragraph tag. Note: a classname and text is assigned to the paragraph, then it is appended to the existing player.

          <p>The paragraph needs to be styled to prevent, in this particular instance, black text on a black background. The following are styles applied to the paragraph's classname.

          <h2><a name"deliverySystem"></a>Delivery system APIs</h2>
          <p>The Delivery System APIs allow for the management and deployment of a group of files, called a repository. These files are managed through REST APIs and through git. These APIs shouldn't be needed by most people when creating or editing players, but they can be a very interesting set of APIs to use for other purposes. If you'd like to try them out, you can <a href="dev-system-api-overview.html">do so here</a>. For a hands-on introduction, try out the <a href="dev-system-quick-start.html">Quick Start to the Delivery System</a>.</p>
