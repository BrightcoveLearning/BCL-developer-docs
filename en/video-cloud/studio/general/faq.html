                <h1>Brightcove Player FAQ</h1>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">What about my existing Smart Players?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">The new Brightcove Player is available today as an option for Video Cloud customers, but you can keep your existing Smart Players while you learn about the new player. You can try the new Brightcove Player without disrupting any of your existing player sites or pages, and you can choose to update them one at a time or all at once - however you like. We have not yet announced an end of life date for the Smart Player, but will provide ample time for migration when this date is determined.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Will my player customizations work?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>Smart Player customization will not work with the new Brightcove Player. The new Brightcove Player has a new extension and customization model based on the HTML5 video standard and relies entirely on Javascript and CSS. Plug-ins can be written to change UI behavior, including player controls, overlays, menus, and integration with third-party tools. See <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/creating-players/configuring-player-plugins.html">Configuring Player Plugins</a> and <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/creating-players/styling-players.html">Styling Players</a> for more details.</p></div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">What features are available today and how do they differ from what’s in the Smart Player?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">The new Brightcove Player has many new and different features compared to the Smart Player. Some popular Smart Player features are not yet available in the new Brightcove Player. Consult this table to see if your requirements match what’s available now and to get a sense for what’s coming soon. See the <a href="player-feature-comparison.html">Player Feature Comparison</a> for details.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I try it?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>You can get started by creating a new player in the new Players Module. Once you’ve configured the player the way you want, you can associate a Video Cloud video with it by specifying a video ID or reference ID from the Media Module from your existing Video Cloud account.</p>
                <p>This <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/getting-started/quick-start-create-publish-player.html">step-by-step guide</a> will show you how you can quickly get started using an existing video with the new Brightcove Player.</p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How does the new Brightcove Player work with my custom CMS workflow?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>With the new Brightcove Player you can now create new players and update existing player configurations without interactively logging-in to Video Cloud Studio. Using the new Player Management API you can add player creation and update steps to your custom workflow by calling out to a simple REST-based API. If you don’t need to update or create a new player configuration, you can easily insert video IDs or reference IDs of videos stored in Brightcove Video Cloud into a copied page template that includes the embed code generated by Video Cloud.</p>
                <p>Refer to the <a href="/en/video-cloud/player-management/index.html">Player Management API documentation</a> to learn how to update your players programmatically as part of your custom publishing workflow.</p>
