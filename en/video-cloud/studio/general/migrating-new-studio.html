                <h1>Migrating to the New Video Cloud Studio FAQ</h1>
                <h2>General information</h2>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Where can I find documentation for the New Video Cloud Studio Beta?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Documentation for the New Video Cloud Studio is available here: <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/studio/index.html">http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/studio/index.html</a>. We will continue to update the documentation and publish training videos as new features are added.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">When is the "end of life" (EOL) date for the current/legacy Studio?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">We do not have a finalized EOL plan for the current/legacy Video Cloud Studio. The approach we will take is to shut down functionality in the current studio gradually and direct customers over to the new studio for tasks that can be completed in both places. The full EOL timeline will follow along with the EOL of the Smart Players as Smart Player management and publishing will not be possible in the New Studio, so we will need to provide access to the old UI until Smart Players are fully EOL’d.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">What are the major benefits of the New Studio over the existing studio UI?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faster and more robust platform that delivers the highest quality playback experience</strong> - Streamlined and intuitive UI designed specifically with fastest time to site publication in mind. Allows customers to manage, publish, distribute and analyze their video content with minimal technical effort on both desktop and mobile browsers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quickly and easily upload videos from any platform</strong> - Use  Video Cloud Studio to upload videos of any size from the desktop, mobile devices, or from nearly any remote file storage location. Select multiple or individual videos via desktop browser or mobile device for fast and easy uploads from anywhere you are.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Optimized transcoding for the best viewer experience</strong> - Automatically generate multiple renditions of each source file using the most advanced encoding technology based on default settings within your account or your custom encoding profile.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Video folders for easier organization management of content by type</strong> - Use folders in the Video Cloud Studio Media module to quickly find and easily keep track of content on different publication sites, in different categories, and in different stages of the review cycle.</li>
                    <li><strong> Create and customize the fastest HTML5 video players on the market</strong> - Easily create and manage HTML5 players in an interactive UI and instantly preview styling and player configuration changes - enable/disable playback settings, video end screens, social sharing, and more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalable open platform for integrating 3rd party technologies</strong> - Utilize Video Cloud APIs across the product to efficiently integrate with existing systems, or add our partner plug-ins to your players through a simple UI to create a rich and extended custom video experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Role-Based Permissioning</strong> - Enable or disable access to modules for users in your account to control what they can see and do. Provide access to the upload module only for users who only upload content but do not publish videos or provide access to the analytics module for analysts within your organization to to view analytics data and create/export reports.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time video performance monitoring and custom reporting to quickly and easily get at the data you need</strong> - Gain insight on viewer behavior and engagement, and identify your best content quickly with easy to read, built-in reports and dashboard monitoring or build customized reports that meet the needs of your organization using a simple report builder UI.</li>
                  </ul></div>
                <h2>Media Module</h2>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I upload videos?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Videos are now uploaded using the <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/studio/upload-module/getting-started/getting-started-upload-module.html">Upload module</a>.  The Media module is not used to upload videos.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">I have a custom transcode profile in the current Video Cloud Studio. Is that profile available in the New Video Cloud Studio?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">
                  <p>No. The profiles in your current/legacy Video Cloud Studio account are not carried over to the New Studio. There are a list of <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/di-api/guides/standard-profiles.html">Brightcove recommended default profiles</a> that you  can choose from when you upload using the Upload Module. Custom profiles must be created using the new Profiles API. Once the custom profile is created for an account using the API, it will be available for selection in the Upload module (and will become the default selection in the Upload module).</p>
                  <p>Currently, changes to the default profiles used by the Upload module must be done by a Brightcove Sales Engineer. Contact your Brightcove Account Manager for more information.</p></div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Do I need to create any special types of renditions?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">
                  <p>The new Brightcove Player defaults to HLS renditions on Desktop. Most Video Cloud customers have at least one (typically multiple) HLS renditions on their videos, but if you don’t have any HLS renditions, you will need to re-transcode or re-upload your videos and use a profile that transcodes to multiple HLS renditions. </p>
                  <p>Currently, changes to the default profiles used by the Upload module must be done by a Brightcove Sales Engineer. Contact your Brightcove Account Manager for more information.</p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Can I access all of my existing videos in the New Video Cloud Studio?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Yes. Your entire Video Cloud catalog is available/accessible in the new Media module. Thumbnails, video still  images as well as all video properties and custom metadata fields will show up  in the new studio.</div>                
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Will my source files be saved when I upload through the New Studio upload module?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">No. The new Upload module uses Dynamic Ingest to ingest and transcode files uploaded through the Upload UI. Dynamic Ingest does not support saving master files, therefore any files uploaded through the new Upload module will not have a master file. </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Are captions supported?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">
                  <p>Yes.  The new Brightcove Player and new Media module support captions in WebVTT format.  Old DFXP captions files will not work for videos published to new Brightcove Players and won’t be displayed in the new Media Module. </p>
                  <p>Note that currently the new Media module does not support the ability to host caption files. That functionality will be coming in a future release. For more information on setting captions in the Media module, see <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/studio/media-module/managing-videos/configuring-text-tracks-captions.html">Configuring Text Tracks to Provide Captions</a>.</p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Can I use the new Media module to publish new Brightcove Players to my production site?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Yes. The new Brightcove Players are fully production ready and generally available to all customers. Any publishers migrating to the new Brightcove Players can use the publishing workflow in the new Media Module to publish videos to new Brightcove Players. </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">What APIs is the New Studio built off of?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">The New Video Cloud Studio is built off of all of the latest and greatest APIs - Dynamic Ingest APIs (Upload module), CMS APIs (Media module), Analytics APIs (Custom Report Generator), and Player Management APIs (Players module).</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I quickly publish a video?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">While there is no Quick Video Publish feature in the Media module, the Media module does allow you to quickly publish videos and playlists.</div>
                <h2>Players Module</h2>
              <h5 class="bcls-question">Can I manage and publish Smart Players in the New Studio?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">No. We do not have any plans at this time to support Smart Player management or publishing in the New Video Cloud Studio. Smart Player management and publishing will remain in the legacy studio and the New Studio (Media and Players modules) will only display/support the New Brightcove Player. We encourage our customer base to migrate over to the New Brightcove Player and do not want to encourage the continued use of Smart Players in the New Studio. </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Will my player customizations work?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>Smart Player customization will not work with the new Brightcove Player. The new Brightcove Player has a new extension and customization model based on the HTML5 video standard and relies entirely on Javascript and CSS. Plug-ins can be written to change UI behavior, including player controls, overlays, menus, and integration with third-party tools. See <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/creating-players/configuring-player-plugins.html">Configuring Player Plugins</a> and <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/creating-players/styling-players.html">Styling Players</a> for more details.</p></div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">What features are available today and how do they differ from what’s in the Smart Player?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">The new Brightcove Player has many new and different features compared to the Smart Player. Some popular Smart Player features are not yet available in the new Brightcove Player. Consult this table to see if your requirements match what’s available now and to get a sense for what’s coming soon. See the <a href="player-feature-comparison.html">Player Feature Comparison</a> for details.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I try it?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>You can get started by creating a new player in the new Players Module. Once you’ve configured the player the way you want, you can associate a Video Cloud video with it by specifying a video ID or reference ID from the Media Module from your existing Video Cloud account.</p>
                <p>This <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/getting-started/quick-start-create-publish-player.html">step-by-step guide</a> will show you how you can quickly get started using an existing video with the new Brightcove Player.</p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How does the new Brightcove Player work with my custom CMS workflow?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>With the new Brightcove Player you can now create new players and update existing player configurations without interactively logging-in to Video Cloud Studio. Using the new Player Management API you can add player creation and update steps to your custom workflow by calling out to a simple REST-based API. If you don’t need to update or create a new player configuration, you can easily insert video IDs or reference IDs of videos stored in Brightcove Video Cloud into a copied page template that includes the embed code generated by Video Cloud.</p>
                <p>Refer to the <a href="/en/video-cloud/player-management/index.html">Player Management API documentation</a> to learn how to update your players programmatically as part of your custom publishing workflow.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Administration</h2>  
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Will all the users on my account show up in my account in the new studio?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Yes. When you log into the New Video Cloud Studio, you will be able to access and switch between all the accounts you are a user on. All the users that were on your account will have access in the New Studio automatically when they log in and navigate to the New Studio URL as well. There are two additional module access roles/restrictions - Upload and Analytics. All existing users that had access to the Media module will have access to the Upload module by default, but you may remove access to Upload module or remove access to Media (and only allow access to Upload) for any users on your account. All existing users will have access to the Analytics module in the New Studio by default as well.</div>
