                <h1>Migrating to the New Video Cloud Studio FAQ</h1>
                <h2>Media Module</h2>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I upload videos?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Videos are now upload using the <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/studio/upload-module/getting-started/getting-started-upload-module.html">Upload module</a>.  The Media module is not used to upload videos.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">I have a custom transcode profile in the current Video Cloud Studio. Is that profile available in the New Video Cloud Studio?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">
                  <p>No. The profiles in your current/legacy Video Cloud Studio account are not carried over to the New Studio. There are a list of <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/di-api/guides/standard-profiles.html">Brightcove recommended default profiles</a> that you  can choose from when you upload using the Upload Module. Custom profiles must be created using the new Profiles API. Once the custom profile is created for an account using the API, it will be available for selection in the Upload module (and will become the default selection in the Upload module).</p>
                  <p>Currently, changes to the default profiles used by the Upload module must be done by a Brightcove Sales Engineer. Contact your Brightcove Account Manager for more information.</p>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Do I need to create any special types of renditions?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">
                  <p>The new Brightcove Player defaults to HLS renditions on Desktop. Most Video Cloud customers have at least one (typically multiple) HLS renditions on their videos, but if you don’t have any HLS renditions, you will need to re-transcode or re-upload your videos and use a profile that transcodes to multiple HLS renditions. </p>
                  <p>Currently, changes to the default profiles used by the Upload module must be done by a Brightcove Sales Engineer. Contact your Brightcove Account Manager for more information.</p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Can I access all of my existing videos in the New Video Cloud Studio?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Yes. Your entire Video Cloud catalog is available/accessible in the new Media module. Thumbnails, video still  images as well as all video properties and custom metadata fields will show up  in the new studio.</div>                
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Can I search videos?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">asasa</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Is Advanced Search available?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">asdasa</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I capture or upload a different video still or thumbnail?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">asadas</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Are captions supported?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">
                  <p>Yes.  The new Brightcove Player and new Media module support captions in WebVTT format.  Old DFXP captions files will not work for videos published to new Brightcove Players and won’t be displayed in the new Media Module. </p>
                  <p>Note that currently the new Media module does not support the ability to host caption files. That functionality will be coming in a future release. For more information on setting captions in the Media module, see <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/studio/media-module/managing-videos/configuring-text-tracks-captions.html">Configuring Text Tracks to Provide Captions</a>.</p>

              <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I add a logo overlay for a video?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"></div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Can I use the new Media module to publish new Brightcove Players to my production site?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">Yes. The new Brightcove Players are fully production ready and generally available to all customers. Any publishers migrating to the new Brightcove Players can use the publishing workflow in the new Media Module to publish videos to new Brightcove Players. </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How can I tell if I video is shared to another account?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"></div>

                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I quickly publish a video?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">While there is no Quick Video Publish feature in the Media module, the Media module does allow you to quickly publish videos and playlists</div>

                <h2>Players Module</h2>
              <h5 class="bcls-question"><span class="bcls-answer">Can I manage and publish Smart Players in the New Studio?</span></h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">No. We do not have any plans at this time to support Smart Player management or publishing in the New Video Cloud Studio. Smart Player management and publishing will remain in the legacy studio and the New Studio (Media and Players modules) will only display/support the New Brightcove Player. We encourage our customer base to migrate over to the New Brightcove Player and do not want to encourage the continued use of Smart Players in the New Studio. </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">Will my player customizations work?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>Smart Player customization will not work with the new Brightcove Player. The new Brightcove Player has a new extension and customization model based on the HTML5 video standard and relies entirely on Javascript and CSS. Plug-ins can be written to change UI behavior, including player controls, overlays, menus, and integration with third-party tools. See <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/creating-players/configuring-player-plugins.html">Configuring Player Plugins</a> and <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/creating-players/styling-players.html">Styling Players</a> for more details.</p></div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">What features are available today and how do they differ from what’s in the Smart Player?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer">The new Brightcove Player has many new and different features compared to the Smart Player. Some popular Smart Player features are not yet available in the new Brightcove Player. Consult this table to see if your requirements match what’s available now and to get a sense for what’s coming soon. See the <a href="player-feature-comparison.html">Player Feature Comparison</a> for details.</div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How do I try it?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>You can get started by creating a new player in the new Players Module. Once you’ve configured the player the way you want, you can associate a Video Cloud video with it by specifying a video ID or reference ID from the Media Module from your existing Video Cloud account.</p>
                <p>This <a href="/en/video-cloud/studio/players-module/getting-started/quick-start-create-publish-player.html">step-by-step guide</a> will show you how you can quickly get started using an existing video with the new Brightcove Player.</p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="bcls-question">How does the new Brightcove Player work with my custom CMS workflow?</h5>
                <div class="bcls-answer"><p>With the new Brightcove Player you can now create new players and update existing player configurations without interactively logging-in to Video Cloud Studio. Using the new Player Management API you can add player creation and update steps to your custom workflow by calling out to a simple REST-based API. If you don’t need to update or create a new player configuration, you can easily insert video IDs or reference IDs of videos stored in Brightcove Video Cloud into a copied page template that includes the embed code generated by Video Cloud.</p>
                <p>Refer to the <a href="/en/video-cloud/player-management/index.html">Player Management API documentation</a> to learn how to update your players programmatically as part of your custom publishing workflow.</p>
