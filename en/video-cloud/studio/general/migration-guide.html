                <h1>Brightcove Player Migration Guide</h1>
                <p>This guide offers information and guidance on migrating from the Flash-based Smart Player to the new Brightcove Player. There are two main sections for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#studio">Video Cloud Studio Users</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#integraters">Integration Developers</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-warning">Note: The new Brightcove Player is available today as an option for Video Cloud customers, but you can keep using the Flash-based Smart Player - it’s not going away. You can try the new Brightcove Player without disrupting any of your existing player sites or pages, and you can choose to update them one at a time or all at once - however you like.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="studio">
                    <h2>Video Cloud Studio Users</h2>
                    <p>If you use Video Cloud Studio to create your players and copy and paste the publishing code into you web pages, migrating to the new Brightcove Player will be straightforward. However, there are a few things to consider before you move forward.</p>
                    <h3>Considerations</h3>
                    <h4>Player features</h4>
                    <p>Although the new Brightcove Player is stable and fully ready for production, we are still adding features to it, and some features available in the old Smart Player are not yet available in the new player. See the <a href="player-feature-comparison.html">Player Feature Comparison</a> for a detailed comparison of current features.</p>
                    <h4>Player customizations</h4>
                    <p>If you have created customized players using BEML, styling, or plugins, you will need to re-create these customizations for the new Brightcove Player. Smart Player customization will not work with the new Brightcove Player. The new Brightcove Player has a new extension and customization model based on <a href="/en/video-cloud/brightcove-player/reference/api/index.html">Javascript</a> and <a href="/en/video-cloud/brightcove-player/guides/customize-appearance.html">CSS</a>. <a href="/en/video-cloud/brightcove-player/guides/plugin-dev-quick-start.html">Plug-ins</a> can be written to change UI behavior, including player controls, overlays, menus, and integration with third-party tools.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section" id="integraters">
                    <h2>Integration Developers</h2>
                    <p>If you integrate Video Cloud with your CMS, the new Brightcove Player is going to make your job easier. With the new Brightcove Player you can now create new players and update existing player configurations without interactively logging-in to Video Cloud Studio. Using the new <a href="/en/video-cloud/player-management/index.html">Player Management Service API</a> you can add player creation and update steps to your custom workflow by calling out to a simple REST-based API. If you don’t need to update or create a new player configuration, you can easily insert video IDs or reference IDs of videos stored in Brightcove Video Cloud into a copied page template that includes the embed code generated by Video Cloud or the Player Management Service.</p>
                    <h3>Now...or wait a little?</h3>
                    <p>Before you begin, however, be aware that there are even better things to come. As we launch the new player, we are also launching a beta version of a new CMS API. This API combines operations from the Player Management API with others that allow you to ingest and interact with videos, providing one API for all your CMS integration needs.</p>
