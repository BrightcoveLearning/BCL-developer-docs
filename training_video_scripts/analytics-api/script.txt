[intro on camera]
Hi, I'm Matt Boles, a learning specialist with Brightcove. In this video, you will learn about the Analytics API:
*what it is
*and why you would want use it.

More specifically, we will start by gaining an understanding of what functionality the Analytics API provides. We will also see common use cases for the API.

Next, we'll see a demonstration that illustrates a vital learning point to understand when using the Analytics API.

Then, we will then move on and look at a couple of demos. The first demo ... The second demo ...

Lastly we will take a quick tour of the Analytics API documentation index page so you can see available resources.

Let's get started with this short introduction.



[slide 1]
The Analytics API allows you to obtain analytics data for your Video Cloud accounts. Data is tracked for, and allows you to query, usage information on the following:
*Account
*Video
*Player
*Live Streams

Specific queries can involve MANY dimensions. A small subset is:
*Views
*Date/Time
*Device OS
*Browser type
*Location (city/country/region)
*Tags on videos
*Unique users

Again, this is a small subset. Also, these dimensions can be combined for very specific queries.




[slide 2]
Although there is an analytics module in Studio, it cannot provide all possible query combinations. Having this server-side, REST-based API provides a way to programmatically access data and have near complete flexibility.

Although not a complete list by any means, here are some typical use cases for Analytics API:
*Retrieve data in JSON or CSV format to create custom charts and displays.
*Use multiple APIs together. For instance, use the Analytics and CMS APIs to to create a playlist of the most viewed videos over a specified time period.



[slide 3 - go into Overview doc and select "Dimensions and field"]
This "Dimensions and fields" section of the overview document, at which we are now viewing, illustrates a vital learning point in understanding and using the Analytics API. Note that we can click on a dimension, like video, and it shows the fields on which you can get information. When another dimension is clicked, like country, the available fields are altered. It is possible, like when selecting the dimensions video and date, nothing can be returned. If you try these combinations that return no fields, and error is generated by the Analytics API.

If you are wondering how to get a certain field back that does not appear with a specific dimension combination, the answer is you can't. The API does not return every field for every dimension/dimension combination. That is why this section of the overview doc is helpful in seeing what is possible.

By the way, all documents and demos we look at during this video  will be highlighted when we look around the documentation later in this video.


[slide 4]
Now that we have some idea about what the Analytics API is, the next question is why would we want to use it? Let's look at a couple of examples that demonstrate the API's use. Next in this video we will see examples for the following:
*Update a player's configuration using cURL
*Update multiple players' configurations using JavaScript

By the way,both of these demos have corresponding documents that detail what is happening. We will look around the documentation later in this video.



[Terminal with cURL player update code ready to go]
Obviously, we can create players in Studio, and also configure players. On rare occasions Studio may not provide the UI for a certain player configuration, in which case we will have to use the Analytics API to configure the player. The example shown here alters the menu that appears when one right-clicks on the player. This is not something editable in Studio.

You see a cURL statement in Terminal which uses the HTTP PATCH method to update a specific player. I will press Enter and provide my password and JSON information is returned. Let's get a cleaner look at the returned data by formatting it. We see information about the player just updated. Note that we would still have to publish the updated player, which can be done either in Studio or with another cURL statement.



[CodePen with JavaScript open that updates multiple players]
The next demo will update multiple players using JavaScript in conjunction with the Analytics API. Again, this could be done in Studio, but it could be a lengthy process if there are numerous players. The basic flow of the app does this:
1. Retrieves a set of players matching some criteria. In the example we will soon see it filters players that have a specific description, but the filter criteria could be just about anything.
2. In a loop, each filtered player is updated according to configuration requirements.
3. Once we are sure all updates are done, in a loop each updated player is published.

Remember, this is all done programmatically and will take nearly the same amount of time if we are updating one player or 100. Also, each of the three steps uses the Analytics API.

Here is a CodePen that executes the app. By default, nothing is displayed on the screen, but I have added some code to provide an insight into what is occurring. For demo purposes the filter applied retrieves only two players. For each of the two players we see the data passed into the Analytics API and the response from the API.




[go to Analytics API landing page https://support.brightcove.com/player-management-api from support.brightcove.com]

The last section of this video will be looking over the documentation available for the Analytics API. This documentation can be found from the Brightcove Support site home page. To get to the API's landing page, click the quick link for the Analytics API.

Here we see a list of all the Analytics API documentation, including an overview, a quick start to help you get started using the API, and the complete API reference. Both demos that were shown in this video have corresponding documents here. Updating a single player is part of the quick start, and there is an entire document dedicated to updating multiple players.

By the way, the Analytics API is one of several platform APIs. If you are an API developer, be sure to check out the other Brightcove APIs that are available.

That's it for this introduction to the Analytics API, thanks for watching!
