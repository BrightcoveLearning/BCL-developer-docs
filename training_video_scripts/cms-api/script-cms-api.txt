[intro on camera]
Hi, I'm Matt Boles, a learning specialist with Brightcove. In this video, you will learn about the Content Management System API, or more commonly, the CMS API:
*what it is
*and why you would want use it.

More specifically, we will start by gaining an understanding of what functionality the CMS API provides. We will also see common use cases for the API.

Then, we will  move on and view a few samples. The samples demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the API.

Lastly, we will take a quick tour of the CMS API documentation index page so you can see available resources.

Let's get started with this short introduction.



[slide 1]
The CMS API provides general management of your Video Cloud videos and playlists, including assets associated with videos like images and audio tracks. The API provides functionality to perform the following tasks on videos and playlists:
*Create
*Update
*Delete
*List
*Count
*Search (videos only)

While some find the search syntax complex, it is also very powerful.



[slide 2]
The CMS API provides a server side, REST-based API to **programmatically** accomplish the tasks just mentioned.

On read type requests, the CMS API provides uncached access to the video and playlist information. By contrast, the Playback API provides cached access to a limited set of data the CMS API manages.

Another way to gain an insight into the CMS API, is to understand that Studio's MEDIA module is a GUI to the API's functionality. Everything done in the MEDIA module invokes calls to the CMS API.



[slide 3]
Some of the most typical use cases for the CMS API are:

The last section of this video will be looking over the documentation available for the CMS API. This documentation can be found from the Brightcove Support site home page. To get to the API's landing page, click the quick link for the CMS API.

Here we see a list of all the CMS API documentation, including an overview, a quick start to help you get started using the API. You also see a set of references, informational documents, and finally samples of using the API alone, and solutions using the CMS API with other Brightcove technologies.

####ROBERT, just FYI, I will point out here the locations of the samples detailed above.####


By the way, the CMS API is one of several platform APIs. If you are an API developer, be sure to check out the other Brightcove APIs that are available.

That's it for this introduction to the CMS API, thanks for watching!
