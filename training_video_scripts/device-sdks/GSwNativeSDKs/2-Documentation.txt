In this video, you will learn how to navigate the developer documentation that is available to help you successfully build apps using the Brightcove Native Player SDKs.
All of Brightcove's user and developer documentation can be found at support.brightcove.com.

From the main landing page at support.brightcove.com, you can access documentation for all of Brightcove's products.
Since the Native SDKs are a feature included with Video Cloud, you can navigate to it by selecting Video Cloud and then Developers.
Here there is a link for Getting Started material as well as a link for all documentation related to the Native SDKs.

 I am selecting the Documentation link.
 This is the main landing page for the Brightcove Native Player SDKs. It is a good one to bookmark because it contains every document related to the Native SDKs.

 Select the Brightcove logo or the Home button at the top to return to the support home page.

 Another way to get to the Native SDK landing page is to expand the Quick Links dropdown menu and select Device SDKs.

 The General Information tab contains high-level information and is a good place to get started with learning about the SDKs. Here, you will find information about how to run the sample apps, links to training videos and a list of features supported by the Native SDKs.

The Android Development tab contains information about building device and TV apps using the Native SDK for Android. For TV apps, this includes Android-based smart TV and the Fire TV.

The Overview document is your go-to reference for general information including supported operating systems, and the current release for the SDK. Here, you can also learn about the plugins you can use to include Advertising, Analytics and Chromecast.

If you are new to the Native SDKs, we recommend that you walk through the Getting Started Learning Path. This starts with the SDK architecture and concludes with a hands-on exercise to build a simple video app. Notice the Learning Path navigation on the right side. This allows you to keep track of your progress and gives you the ability to jump between documents if you need to review a concept again.

The Guides provide more detailed and specific information about using features with the Native SDK.

The resources section includes code samples, code snippets, training videos, reference documentation and release notes.

The iOS Development tab has a similar set of documents.
The Overview document contains information about the SDK including supported operating systems, the current release for the SDK and plugins to add functionality for Advertising, Analytics and Chromecast.

There are a set of guides to help you implement features supported by the SDK.

The resources section includes code samples, code snippets, training videos, reference documentation and release notes.

Even though tvOS Development is a separate tab, the code is contained within the Native SDK for iOS.
Using tvOS, you can build apps for Apple TV.
Here you will find a similar set of Getting Started documents, a collection of guides and links to code samples, references and release notes.

In the Developer Support tab, you will find announcements about the Native SDKs.
The Help section includes links for the SDK Developer forum, frequently asked questions, Known issues and how to open a support ticket.

If you can't find what you are looking for, there is a search bar on the top of every page that will search every document in the Brightcove Support system.


In the next videos, you will learn how to run the sample apps provided for the Native SDKs.

Hi, I'm Jeff Doktor, a learning specialist with Brightcove. Welcome to the on-demand training course for Developing with the Brightcove Native Player SDK for iOS.

In this course, you will learn how to create a Swift project in Xcode that uses the Native SDK. This app will play a video from your Video Cloud library.

There are several tasks involved, so let's take a look at those now.


(end of video of me)

(switch to slides)
Here is the agenda for the course.
First, I'll give you a high level overview of the Brightcove Native Player SDK for iOS. We'll learn what it is and who can use it.

Then, we'll look at the tools you will need, and show you where you can find documentation, code samples and a developer forum. In the forum, you can post questions and find answers to common questions.

Next, we'll look a little deeper into understanding the Native SDK for iOS.

Then, we'll walk thru the steps of building an iOS app.

To do this, we'll Create a Swift project in Xcode.
Import the Native SDK for iOS into your project.
Define the audio behavior for the app.
Add a playback controller to your app.
Get a video from your Video Cloud library.
We'll connect the Storyboard View.
Then, We'll decide whether you want to deliver your media content over a secure connection.
Finally, we will Run the app in the Xcode Simulator.

(back to speaking)
Hopefully, you'll find this training course helpful.

We have a lot to accomplish, so let's get started.
