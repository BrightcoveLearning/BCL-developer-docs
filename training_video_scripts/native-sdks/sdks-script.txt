[intro]
The Brightcove Native SDKs enable you to build powerful, video apps for mobile devices and connected TV.

They are built on top of native frameworks, allowing you to leverage the speed, performance and flexibility of the native operating system.

The Native SDKs facilitate integrations with content protection, advertising and analytics.

Through partnerships with some of the biggest names in online video advertising, such as DoubleClick and FreeWheel, we provide plug-ins that integrate with the core Brightcove SDK in just a few lines of code.

If you are concerned about ad blockers, you can utilize Brightcove's server-side ad insertion to embed ads into your content stream.

As data consumers ourselves, we recognize that analytics provides important information for understanding trends in your content.
The Brightcove SDKs allow you to easily gather data, whether you're a Video Cloud customer using Brightcove Analytics, a Brightcove Player customer using the Analytics APIs with your own backend, or some combination with a third party integration, such as Omniture.

With HLSe, FairPlay and Widevine support, app developers can choose the level of protection they want. Our engineers are active in the iOS and Android communities and stay up-to-date with the latest standards and build tools.

For the Native SDKs, simplicity is key.
Every feature released is designed to be integrated with the least lines of code and ship with working sample applications that guide you through implementing them yourselves.

Our goal with the Brightcove Native SDKs is to enable you to get a quality, versatile video experience into your app quickly and easily.
