    <p>In this video, you will get an introduction to the Brightcove Platform APIs. The platform apis provide programmatic access to data associated with your Brightcove account, including videos, players, ingest profiles, analytics, and more. The platform apis allow you to create almost all of the functionality of Brightcove studio within your own custom apps or your CMS system.</p>

<p>We will look at the individual APIs in more detail in other videos. Here will just look at what they have in common.</p>
[show insomnia request/response]
<p>All the platform are REST APIs, meaning that they are accessed through HTTP requests, using different methods for different kinds of requests, sometimes including a request body in JSON format. Responses also come back in JSON format. Depending on the kind of request, the response may contain an elaborate data object, or, if the operation requested is asynchronous - a request to ingest a video, for example, the response may be just a job id you can use to track the progress of the operation.</p>
<p>And some requests, particularly requests to delete an asset of some kind, will generally return an HTTP 204 response with no content.</p>

<p>Authentication for API requests is generally managed by our OAuth API, which can be used to create client credentials that are then used to get access tokens for requests. This is explained in more detail in the videos and documentation for the OAuth API. A few of the APIs use an API key instead of access tokens for authentication.</p>

<p>There are several tools that you can use to test API requests, and we have provided instructions for setting up and using these. The simplest is a command line tool called CURL. To simplify the use of CURL, Brightcove Learning Services has created a shell script that prompts you for the necessary inputs, fetches an access token, makes the request, and displays a pretty-printed response. There are also several desktop apps you can use. The most popular are Insomnia and Postman, which make it easy to set up the authentication and save your requests in collections.</p>

<p>We've also create an extensive collection of code samples for the the platform APIs. These are web apps that use JavaScript send API requests via a proxy app built in PHP. They are built in CodePens to make it easy for you to experiment with them, and the code is also saved in GitHub repositories for you to download and modify to fit your needs.</p>
