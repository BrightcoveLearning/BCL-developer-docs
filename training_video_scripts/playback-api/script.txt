In this video, you will learn how to retrieve your media content from your Brightcove Video Cloud library using the Playback API.

The Playback API is designed for low latency, which means the time it takes to access your data is minimal. To maximize performance, your data is cached for a short period of time by the Playback API. Lastly, the Playback API results are filtered to only return playable videos. This means your player can start video playback as soon as one rendition exists. Because of this, the Playback API is optimized for use by your client-side web and mobile applications.

If you need a general media management API or need to return videos that are not currently playable, you should use the CMS API.

To get started, you will need a Policy Key for your account.

The Policy Key is used for authentication to access your media data using the Playback API.
For more information about Policy Keys, review the support documents for the Policy API.

The Playback API is read-only and supports requests to get a video or playlist using an ID. You can also retrieve multiple videos from a search request.

To perform a search with the Playback API you will need a search-enabled Policy Key.

To learn how to create a search-enabled Policy Key, see the Search Videos section of the Policy API Overview document.

Using a search-enabled Policy Key, we can use the q parameter to search our media using required and excluded terms, custom fields and date ranges.

To get started with search, review the Videos search document. The q parameters can be used with either the Playback or CMS API.

If your search returns a large number of results, you can sort the results. You can also page through your results list using the limit and offset parameters.

Let's take a look at the Quick Start provided for the Playback API.
This example shows you what to expect when retrieving data from the API.
The account ID and Policy Key will be used for all of the Playback API requests. Note that we are using a search-enabled Policy Key so that we can search our videos.

The Get a Video button uses the Video ID to return data for a specific video. When I select the button, we can see the request that was sent to the Playback API. Here we can see our account ID and video ID.

The response contains the data details for our video.

I am selecting the Get a Playlist button. In the API request, we can see our account ID and playlist ID.
The response contains our playlist, which includes metadata for each video in our playlist.

Finally, I am selecting the Search for Videos button.
Here, the request contains our account ID and the q search parameter. In this example, we are retrieving all videos in our account that have a tag value of "sample".

In the response, we can see a list of videos which meet the search criteria. If we look at one of the video's metadata, we can see that the tag value is "sample".

Whether your client-side app uses a web browser, mobile device or TV, you can retrieve your Video Cloud media data using the Playback API.
Now, you are ready to try it on your own.

By the way, the Playback API is one of several platform APIs. If you are an API developer, be sure to check out the other Brightcove APIs that are available.
