[question?]
Are you wondering how to get videos and playlists from your Video Cloud library to play them on your web pages or in your mobile apps?

[intro]
Hi, I'm Jeff Doktor, a learning specialist at Brightcove. In this video, you will learn how to retrieve your media content from your Video Cloud library.

[slides]
In this video, you will learn how to retrieve your media content from your Brightcove Video Cloud library using the Playback API.

The Playback API is designed for low latency, which means the time it takes to access your data is minimal. To maximize performance, your data is cached for a short period of time by the Playback API. Lastly, the Playback API results are filtered to only return playable videos. This means your player can start video playback as soon as one rendition exists. Because of this, the Playback API is optimized for use by your client-side web and mobile applications.  

If you need a general media management API or need to return videos that are not currently playable, you should use the CMS API. 

To get started, you will need a Policy Key for your account.

The Policy Key is used for authentication to access your media data using the Playback API.
For more information about Policy Keys, review the support documents for the Policy API.

The Playback API is read-only and supports requests to get a video or playlist using an ID. You can also retrieve multiple videos from a search request. 

To perform a search with the Playback API you will need a search-enabled Policy Key.

With google's Video Suite Inspector, you can validate that your ad tag functions correctly. I am pasting in my VMAP ad tag URL and selecting the TEST AD button. We can see that the ad starts playing, so we know the ad tag is setup correctly. Now that we know the ad tag is valid, we can configure our player in Video Cloud studio.

[open Players module in Studio]
I am navigating to the Player's module and creating a new player. I am calling it SSAI player.
Next, we'll configure the player for server-side ads.

I am selecting the SSAI player link and selecting Advertising in the left side navigation.

I am selecting server-side advertising and choosing an ad configuration that has been defined for my account.

[home support page > select SSAI product > select SSAI Ad Config API]
You will use the SSAI API to create an ad configuration for an account.
For details, see the SSAI Ad Config API support document.

[return to Studio]
Notice that if you select both client-side and server-side advertising, your player will be set up for ad failover. This means that the Brightcove player will attempt to play your client-side IMA ads. If an ad blocker is detected in the browser, then your server-side ads will play based on your defined ad configuration.

We have enabled ad information overlays. This enables overlays, including Learn More links and ad countdown overlays, to display over the ads.

When using Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI), Brightcove recommends setting preload=none. If preload is set to auto or metadata, the first frames of the video stream will be requested, which counts the ad as delivered even if the user does not start playback. To do this, I am selecting Playback in the left-side navigation. For the Preload Video Before Playback option, I am selecting Do not preload.

Now, we have configured our player to use server-side ads.
Behind the scenes, the SSAI plugin has been added to our player.

I want to point out that there are additional settings for this plugin that can't be set on this page, but you can configure them manually. For details, see the developer documentation for these options.

I am publishing the player.

I am going to the Media module to publish a video with the SSAI player we just created.

I am selecting the link to view the player. When I start video playback, the pre-roll ad begins to play. When the ad is finished, my video begins playback.

That's all you need to do to configure a player to display server-side ads.

----------------------------------------------------------- Not Used -------------------------------
One thing to keep in mind, is that the video creative most be encoded in a format that supports HTML5 playback. If your video ad creative is an FLV file, the ad will not be playable in HTML5 players.
