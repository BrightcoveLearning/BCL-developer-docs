[intro]
Hi, I'm Matt Boles, a learning specialist at Brightcove. In this video, you will learn about the Player Management API:
*what it is
*and why you would want use it.

Let's get started with this short introduction.



[slide 1]
First, let's understand what we mean by player management in general. By this phrase we mean tasks you might need to perform on Brightcove Players, for instance:
*create
*delete
*update (change configuration)
*list
*publish

It is very possible you currently use Studio for these tasks.



[slide 2]
Next, we want to understand what the Player Management **API** is. It provides a server side, REST-based API to **programmatically** accomplish the tasks just mentioned. In our documentation, and in this video, we will use cURL and JavaScript to demonstrate the programmatic use of the API.

Another way to gain an insight into the Player Management API is to understand that Studio's PLAYERS module is a GUI to the API's functionality. Everything done in the PLAYERS module invokes calls to the Player Management API.



[slide 3]
Now we have some idea about what the Player Management API is, the next question is why would I want to use it? Let's look at a few examples of the API's use. In this video you will see examples for the following:
*Create a player using cURL
*Update a player using cURL
*Update multiple players using JavaScript



[Terminal with cURL player creation code ready to go]
The first demo is a good introductory management task, that is creating a player. Since this is a REST-based API we will use the HTTP POST method to perform the creation. You can use either curl, or a tool like Insomnia or Postman to help with the task. By the way, we have documentation on using both Insomnia and Postman.

I'm not going to go into detail discussing the cURL statement, but more demo its use. You can read the Quick Start: Player Management API document for a discussion of the code.

I will press Enter and provide my password to execute the cURL statement. You see the API returned information about the newly created player.


[change to Terminal, with create player curl statement already in]
Here you see the terminal with a curl statement ready to go. I will press enter, provide my password and get information back that the Player Management API did in fact create a player. For details on the curl statement, and what is returned, see the first section of the Quick Start: Player Management document.

The documentation for the Player Management API can be found on the Brightcove Support site.
From the documentation home page, select the quick link for the Player Management API.

On the Player Management API landing page, you will find documentation, including an overview, a quick start, and a guide for how to get the Player Management Key from a player in your Brightcove account.
There is also a complete reference for the API.

Let's look at the Player Management Keys from players document.

Because a Player Management Key is automatically generated when you create a Brightcove Player, you can get the key from the player configuration details.
Keep in mind that Player Management Keys automatically generated for new Brightcove Players are not search-enabled.

Now, let's look at the Quick Start for the Player Management API.

[Quick Start Player Management API]
https://support.brightcove.com/quick-start-Player Management-api
The Quick Start includes a section that explains how to get your credentials needed for accessing the Player Management API.
There is also a sample app for creating a simple Player Management Key.
You can provide your information for Account Id, Client Id and Client Secret, and then create a Player Management Key for your account.

Remember, to perform video searches from the Playback API, you will need a search-enabled Player Management Key.

I am leaving the default input values and selecting the Create the Player Management Key button.
Here, we can see that a new Player Management Key has been created in the Brightcove sample account.

For more details, refer to the Brightcove support documents.
Now, you are ready to experiment on your own with the Player Management API.


By the way, the Player Management API is one of several platform APIs. If you are an API developer, be sure to check out the other Brightcove APIs that are available to you.
