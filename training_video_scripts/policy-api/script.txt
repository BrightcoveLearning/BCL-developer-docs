[question?]How would you like to build native video apps for iOS devices?

Hi, I'm Jeff Doktor. In this video, you will get an introduction to the Policy API. This API is one of Brightcove's platform APIs.
It allows you to create and view Policy Keys for your account.

The documentation for the Policy API can be found on the Brightcove Support site.

The documentation includes an overview, a quick start, as well as a guide about how to get the Policy Key from a player in your Brightcove account.
There is also a complete reference for the API.

[Policy API overview]

The Policy Key is used with the Playback API to retrieve video and playlist content from your Video Cloud library.

Because a Policy Key is automatically generated when you create a Brightcove Player, you can use this key for simple requests.
We'll look at use cases for creating a Policy Key using the Policy API.

Policy Keys are used to limit access to your video content based on:
account
domain restrictions
and geo restrictions
