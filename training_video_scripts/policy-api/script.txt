[question?]How would you like to build native video apps for iOS devices?

Hi, I'm Jeff Doktor. In this video, you will get an introduction to the Policy API. This API is one of Brightcove's platform APIs.
It allows you to create and view Policy Keys for your account.

The documentation for the Policy API can be found on the Brightcove Support site.

The documentation includes an overview, a quick start, as well as a guide about how to get the Policy Key from a player in your Brightcove account.
There is also a complete reference for the API.

[Policy API overview]

The Policy Key is used with the Playback API to retrieve video and playlist content from your Video Cloud library.

Policy Keys are read only and can be used to limit access to your video content based on:
account
domain restrictions
and geo restrictions

Because a Policy Key is automatically generated when you create a Brightcove Player, you can get the key from the player configuration details.
This is shown in the Policy Keys support document.

[Policy API reference]

The Policy API allows you to create a Policy Key and get the configuration details for a Policy Key.

[Quick Start Policy API]
https://support.brightcove.com/quick-start-policy-api

The Quick Start for the Policy API has a link for how to get API credentials needed for accessing the API.
There is also a sample app for creating a simple Policy Key.
You can provide your information for Account Id, Client Id and Client Secret, and then select the Create the Policy Key button.

Keep in mind that to perform video searches from the Playback API, you will need a search-enabled Policy Key.
Policy Keys automatically generated for new Brightcove Players are not search-enabled by default.

I am leaving the default input values and selecting the Create the Policy Key button.
Here, we can see that a new Policy Key has been created in the Brightcove sample account.

For more details, refer to the Brightcove support documents.
Now, you are ready to experiment on your own with the Policy API.
